<div class="row box">
<div class="col-xs-12">
<p>During the 1837-38 school year, when Herman Melville was eighteen, his 16-year-old sister Augusta wrote a set of high school compositions focusing on various topics (including the execution of Lady Jane Grey, the character of Christ, and the poetry of Felicia Hemans).&#160; Herman and Augusta's older brother Gansevoort&#8212;who was 22 at the time and head of the Melville household in Lansingburgh, NY, just north of Troy&#8212;was always available to "correct" Augusta&#8217;s essays, and Gansevoort&#8217;s penciled revisions to her writing are evident in some of her surviving compositions, located in the Gansevoort-Lansing Collection at the New York Public Library.&#160; Although Herman&#8217;s high school compositions have not been found, Gansevoort probably vetted his schoolwork as well as other early writing, for evidence of his penciled editorial interventions can be found on the <em>Typee</em> manuscript, a three-chapter fragment of the 1845 working draft of Melville&#8217;s first novel, published in 1846.</p>
<p>Finding Gansevoort&#8217;s &#8220;hand&#8221; on Augusta&#8217;s and Herman&#8217;s drafts suggests that as the three siblings developed through adolescence, they constituted a coterie of family writers.&#160; Ostensibly, the older Gansevoort was proctoring his younger brother and sister as he was himself growing through various transitions in his precocious life&#8212;bankrupt hat-making entrepreneur, lawyer, politician, and diplomat&#8212;before his untimely death in 1846. &#160;During the late 1830s, Herman was writing letters to local papers about his debating society, inscribing poetry in the back of a book (and probably writing his own poems), and publishing locally his earliest known sketches, titled <em>Fragments from a Writing Desk</em>.&#160; And Augusta was working on her compositions, of which eleven survive: some are drafts; others, final versions.</p>
<p>In the NYPL cache of compositions is a four-page fragment of what appears to be a term paper on a topic best characterized as: What can human effort, leadership, or power among the famous and infamous men of history, politics, and religion&#8212;Washington, Grotius, Luther, Fulton, Charlemagne, Napoleon&#8212;accomplish for good or ill? &#160;The fragment is the inner sheet, folded once to create four pages, of what was probably a two-sheet composition.&#160; The lost outer sheet, also folded to create four pages, probably contained the essay&#8217;s title, introduction, and conclusion as well as the opening and closing examples of the essay&#8217;s body section.&#160; Internal textual evidence&#8212;a reference to the reburial of George Washington in October 1837&#8212;in the context of the dating of Augusta&#8217;s other, earlier compositions indicates that this longer, term paper may have been written in response to an end-of-year assignment in Spring, 1838.&#160; Unlike Augusta&#8217;s earlier compositions, which are lightly edited by Augusta and in some instances Gansevoort, Augusta&#8217;s term paper on human effort, leadership, or power has been heavily revised by Gansevoort.&#160; The document is a fascinating instance of layered voices: not only older brother superimposed on younger sister but also Augusta's idealism and reverence interfused with Gansevoort's ambition, politics, and nationalism.&#160; Beyond the document&#8217;s use in further exploring the Melville sibling coterie, Augusta&#8217;s draft composition reveals an early nineteenth-century family dynamic regarding the process of writing, or rather of learning to write, that resonates with today&#8217;s study of composition and rhetoric</p>
<p>To compare these sibling writers using Juxta, I transcribed Augusta&#8217;s term paper fragment twice:&#160; once to achieve the final reading text of Augusta's original and a second time to achieve the final reading text of Gansevoort's revision.&#160; I then uploaded the texts of both witnesses into Juxta Commons.&#160; <a href="http://juxtacommons.org/shares/ruqAkx/sidebyside?docs=2818,2819&amp;top=0" target="_blank">The comparison set viewed here</a> uses Augusta&#8217;s text as the base version. <span>&#160;</span></p>
<p>The Melville Electronic Library (MEL) has adapted Juxta to its online manuscript transcription tool TextLab so that different versions of a work can be collated.&#160; In MEL&#8217;s version of Juxta Commons, users can click on revision sites, indicated by Juxta&#8217;s highlighting of variant text, and view a dialog box that sequences the two versions and permits the user to write a &#8220;revision narrative&#8221; that offers arguments about the revision.&#160; Once digital images of Augusta&#8217;s composition are made available, they can be processed through TextLab, thus giving users access to MEL&#8217;s added Revision Sequence/Narrative feature.</p>
