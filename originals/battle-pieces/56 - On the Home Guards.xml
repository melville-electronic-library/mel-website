</p><p>On the Home Guards
who perished in the Defense of Lexington, Missouri

</p><p>The men who here in harness died
  Fell not in vain, though in defeat.
They by their end well fortified
  The Cause, and built retreat
(With memory of their valor tried)
For emulous hearts in many an after frayâ€”
Hearts sore beset, which died at bay.</p></body>
