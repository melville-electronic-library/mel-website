[Criticism—Canonical] In his own copy of Battle-Pieces, Melville drew a line through the poem’s title. Howard P. Vincent argues that Melville did so “probably feeling that is [sic] was inflammatory and provocative” and not conducive to national healing (456). 
[Criticism—recent] [Intertextuality] Robillard prompts readers to compare Melville’s poem on Lincoln’s assassination to Walt Whitman’s “When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom’d” and “O Captain! My Captain!” (189).

[Allusion—biblical] the “Passion” refers to the “last suffering of the Savior” (Webster), i.e. the physical, psychological, and spiritual suffering endured by Jesus from the Last Supper to his death; his Crucifixion.

[Intratextuality] Cohen points to Battle-Pieces poem “The Scout Toward Aldie” as another example of Melville’s “use of ballad conventions” (266).
