</p><p>An Old Sailor&amp;apos;s Lament.

</p><p>(December, 1861.)

</p><p>_________________

</p><p>I Have a feeling for those ships,
Each worn and ancient one,
With great <ref target="#ref_20706">bluff bows</ref><note xml:id="ref_20706">[Criticism: Canonical] [Source] Cohen connects Melville's language here with the <i>Rebellion Record's</i> republishing of a correspondent's account of the event, originally published in the New York <i>Tribune</i>. The correspondent writes, "her bluff bows nod to us rather gracefully" (219). </note>, and broad in the beam:
Ay, it was unkindly done.
But so they serve the <ref target="#ref_20304">Obsolete</ref><note xml:id="ref_20304"></note>—
Even so, Stone Fleet!

</p><p>You&amp;apos;ll say I&amp;apos;m doting; do but think
I scudded round the Horn in one—
The Tenedos, a glorious
Good old craft as ever run—
Sunk (how all unmeet!)
With the Old Stone Fleet.

</p><p>An India ship of fame was she,
Spices and shawls and fans she bore;

Turned off! till, spent and poor,
Her bones were sold (<ref target="#ref_20705">escheat</ref><note xml:id="ref_20705">[Criticism: Canonical] Cohen reads the term as "reversion to the rightful owner, in this instance the sea" (219). </note>)!
Ah! Stone Fleet.

</p><p>Four were erst patrician keels
(Names attest what families be)
The Kensington, and Richmond too,
Leonidas, and Lee:
But now they have their seat
With the Old Stone Fleet.

</p><p>To scuttle them—a pirate deed—
Sack them, and dismast;
They sunk so slow, they died so hard,
But gurgling dropped at last.
Their ghosts in gales repeat
Woe&amp;apos;s us, Stone Fleet!

</p><p>And all for naught. The waters pass—
Currents will have their way;
Nature is nobody&amp;apos;s ally; &amp;apos;tis well;
<name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:516" type="place">The harbor</name> is bettered—will stay.
A failure, and complete,
Was your Old Stone Fleet.
