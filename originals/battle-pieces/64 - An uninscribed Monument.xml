(Christina Lee)</note></ref><note xml:id="ref_21288">NOTE: [Critical] Caddell suggests that the modified sonnet form and the thematic tensions between silence and speaking “betray a genre at its breaking point but also signal a possible way out of the crisis” (310). Finseth argues that the formal and thematic characteristics of this poem points towards “the process of building ‘nascent’ moral perspectives” (85). (Christina Lee)</note>
on one of the Battle-fields of the Wilderness

</p><p>Silence and Solitude may hint
  (Whose home is in yon piny wood)
What I, though tableted, could never tell—
The din which here befell,
  And striving of the multitude.
The iron cones and spheres of death
  Set round me in their rust,
    These, too, if just,
Shall speak with more than animated breath.
  Thou who beholdest, if thy thought,
Not narrowed down to personal cheer,
Take in the import of the quiet here—
  The after-quiet—the calm full fraught;
Thou too wilt silent stand—
Silent as I, and lonesome as the land.</p></body>
