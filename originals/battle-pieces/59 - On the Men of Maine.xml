Breckinridge attempted to recapture New Orleans from Union forces. The Maine regiment held their position and the Union forces were able to drive the Confederates off. Both sides suffered major casualties. Garner suggests that Melville’s comparative use of the geographic features of Maine and Louisiana in the poem emphasizes the Maine men’s “true spirit of union”: “[t]hey had risked their lives because, however distant and alien it might seem, this place was still their country” (Garner 181).

</p><p>Afar they fell. It was the zone
  Of fig and orange, cane and lime
(A land how all unlike their own,
With the cold pine-grove overgrown),
  But still their Country&amp;apos;s clime.
And there in youth they died for her—
      The Volunteers,
For her went up their dying prayers:
  So vast the Nation, yet so strong the tie.
What doubt shall come, then, to deter
  The Republic&amp;apos;s earnest faith and courage high.</p></body>
