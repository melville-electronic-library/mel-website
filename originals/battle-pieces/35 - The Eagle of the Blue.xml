  Who is the brother of the star;
The bird whose joy is in the wind
  Exultleth in the war.

</p><p>Austere, he crowns the swaying perch,
  Flapped by the angry flag;
The hurricane from the battery sings,

  Strength which, though chained, avails;

  No deadly hurt he knew;
Well may we think his years are charmed—
  The Eagle of the Blue.</p></body>
