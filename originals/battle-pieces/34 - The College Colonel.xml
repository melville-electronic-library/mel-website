  A crutch by his saddle just slants in view,
One slung arm is in splints, you see,
  Yet he guides his strong steed—how coldly too.

Like castaway sailors, who—stunned
    By the surf&amp;apos;s loud roar,

Again and again breast the surge,

  An Indian aloofness lones his brow;
He has lived a thousand years
Compressed in battle&amp;apos;s pains and prayers,
  Marches and watches slow.
