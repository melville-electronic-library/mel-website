</p><p>Head-board and foot-board duly placed—
  Grassed in the mound between;
Daniel Drouth is the slumberer&amp;apos;s name—
  Long may his grave be green!

</p><p>Quick was his way—a flash and a blow,
  Full of his fire was he—
A fire of hell—&amp;apos;tis burnt out now—
  Green may his grave long be!

</p><p>May his grave be green, though he
  Was a rebel of iron mould;
Many a true heart—true to the Cause,
  Through the blaze of his wrath lies cold.

</p><p>May his grave be green—still green
  While happy years shall run;
May none come nigh to disinter
  The—<hi rend="italic">Buried Gun</hi>.</p></body>
