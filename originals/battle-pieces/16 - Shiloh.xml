New York Nation (Parker, II, 621) [Intertextuality] "The Old Sergeant" (1863) was republished in Edmund Clarence Stedman's An American Anthology, 1787-1900 (1900): https://www.bartleby.com/248/710.html</note>.

</p><p>Skimming lightly, wheeling still,
    The swallows fly low
Over the field in clouded days,
    The forest-field of <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:463" type="place">Shiloh</name>—
Over the field where April rain
Solaced the parched ones stretched in pain
Through the pause of night
That followed <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/event:38" type="event">the Sunday fight</name>
    Around the church of Shiloh—
The church so lone, the log-built one,
That echoed to many a parting groan
        And natural prayer
    Of dying foemen mingled there—
Foemen at morn, but friends at eve—
    Fame or country least their care:

While over them the swallows skim,
