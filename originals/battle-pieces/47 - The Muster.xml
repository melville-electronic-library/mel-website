(Cohen, 271) [reference, etymology, geography, biblical]</note>—
  Patriarch of floods,
Calls the roll of all his streams
  And watery mutitudes:
      Torrent cries to torrent,
        The rapids hail the fall;
      With shouts the inland freshets
        Gather to the call.
    
	The quotas of the Nation,
      Like the water-shed of waves,
    Muster into union—
      Eastern warriors, Western braves.

      Though distant far the bands,
    And the wheeling of the squadrons
      Is like surf upon the sands.
    
	The bladed guns are gleaming—
      Drift in lengthened trim,
    Files on files for hazy miles—
      Nebulously dim.

      Star rising after star,
    New banners of the Commonwealths,
 	  And eagles of the War.

</p><p>The Abrahamic river
  To sea-wide fullness fed,
Pouring from the thaw-lands
  By the God of floods is led:
      His deep enforcing current
        The streams of ocean own,
