(SUPPLIED BY A SUB-SUB-LIBRARIAN.)
It will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and grub-worm of a poor devil of a Sub-Sub appears to have gone through the long <ref target="#ref_19454">Vaticans</ref><note xml:id="ref_19454">Vaticans: great libraries, such as the Vatican's in <ref type='reference' target='https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:14'>Vatican City</ref></note> and street-stalls of the earth, picking up whatever random allusions to whales he could anyways find in any book whatsoever, sacred or profane. Therefore you must not, in every case at least, take the higgledy-piggledy whale statements, however authentic, in these extracts, for veritable gospel cetology. Far from it. As touching the ancient authors generally, as well as the poets here appearing, these extracts are solely valuable or entertaining, as affording a glancing bird’s eye view of what has been <ref target="#ref_19455">promiscuously</ref><note xml:id="ref_19455">promiscuously: diversely; unsystematically. </note> said, thought, fancied, and sung of <ref target="#ref_19456">Leviathan</ref><note xml:id="ref_19456">Leviathan: biblical sea creature, not necessarily a whale.</note>, by many nations and generations, including our own.

“In the free element beneath me swam,
Floundered and dived, in play, in chace, in battle,
Fishes of every color, form, and kind;
Which language cannot paint, and mariner
Had never seen; from dread Leviathan
To insect millions peopling every wave:
Gather’d in shoals immense, like floating islands,
Led by mysterious instincts through that waste
And trackless region, though on every side
Assaulted by voracious enemies,
Whales, sharks, and monsters, arm’d in front or jaw,
With swords, saws, spiral horns, or hooked fangs.”

Gather’d in shoals immense, like floating islands,
Led by mysterious instincts through that waste

Assaulted by voracious enemies,
Whales, sharks, and monsters, arm’d in front or jaw,
With swords, saws, spiral horns, or hooked fangs.”
