SUNSET
<hi rend="italic">The cabin; by the stern windows; Ahab sitting alone, and gazing out.</hi>

</p><p>I LEAVE a white and turbid wake; pale waters, paler cheeks, where’er I sail. The envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track; let them; but first I pass.

</p><p>Yonder, by the ever-brimming goblet’s rim, the warm waves blush like wine. The gold brow plumbs the blue. The diver sun—slow dived from noon,—goes down; my soul mounts up! she wearies with her endless hill. Is, then, the crown too heavy that I wear? this <ref target="#ref_16567"><name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/artwork:1080" type="artwork">Iron Crown of Lombardy</name></ref><note xml:id="ref_16567">Iron Crown of Lombardy: Ancient crown used at coronations of the Holy Roman emperors, and supposed to contain a nail from the True Cross. According to Dennis Berthold, a gold band and precious stones were added to the crown.</note>. Yet is it bright with many a gem; I, the wearer, see not its far flashings; but darkly feel that I wear that, that dazzlingly confounds. ’Tis iron—that I know—not gold. ’Tis split, too—that I feel; the jagged edge galls me so, my brain seems to beat against the solid metal; aye, steel skull, mine; the sort that needs no helmet in the most brain-battering fight!

</p><p>Dry heat upon my brow? Oh! time was, when as the sunrise nobly spurred me, so the sunset soothed. No more. This lovely light, it lights not me; all loveliness is anguish to me, since I can ne’er enjoy. Gifted with the high perception, I lack the low, enjoying power; damned, most subtly and most malignantly! damned in the midst of Paradise! Good night—good night! (<hi rend="italic">waving his hand, he moves from the window.</hi>)

</p><p>’Twas not so hard a task. I thought to find one stubborn, at the least; but my one cogged circle fits into all their various wheels, and they revolve. Or, if you will, like so many ant-hills of powder, they all stand before me; and I their match. Oh, hard! that to fire others, the match itself must needs be wasting! What I’ve dared, I’ve willed; and what I’ve willed, I’ll do! They think me mad—Starbuck does; but I’m <ref target="#ref_17047">demoniac</ref><note xml:id="ref_17047">demoniac: Because he is aware of his madness, Ahab claims he is therefore not crazy; it is as if an internal demon or “dæmon” controls and uses his insanity. In Plato’s Symposium and in Romantic poetry, a “dæmon” mediates between heaven and earth or gives human form to ideal truths. In this sense, Ahab’s demonism is more spiritual than supernatural.</note>, I am madness maddened! That wild madness that’s only calm to comprehend itself! The <ref target="#ref_17046">prophecy</ref><note xml:id="ref_17046">prophecy: See Ch. 19.</note> was that I should be dismembered; and—Aye! I lost this leg. I now prophesy that I will dismember my dismemberer. Now, then, be the prophet and the fulfiller one. That’s more than ye, ye great gods, ever were. I laugh and hoot at ye, ye cricket-players, ye pugilists, <ref target="#ref_17048">ye deaf Burkes and blinded Bendigoes</ref><note xml:id="ref_17048">deaf Burkes and blinded Bendigoes!: William Thompson (a triplet whose childhood nickname, Abednego, was mispronounced Bendigo) won the heavyweight boxing championship of England in 1839 against James (“The Deaf ’Un”) Burke.</note>! I will not say as schoolboys do to bullies,—Take some one of your own size; don’t pommel me! No, ye’ve knocked me down, and I am up again; but ye have run and hidden.

I have no long gun to reach ye. Come, Ahab’s compliments to ye; come and see if ye can swerve me. Swerve me? ye cannot swerve me, else ye swerve yourselves! man has ye there. Swerve me? The path to my fixed purpose is laid with iron rails, whereon my <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/artwork:1081" type="artwork">soul is grooved to run</name>. Over unsounded gorges, through the rifled hearts of mountains, under torrents’ beds, unerringly I rush!
