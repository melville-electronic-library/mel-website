(SUPPLIED BY A LATE <ref target="#ref_19450">CONSUMPTIVE USHER</ref><note xml:id="ref_19450">Consumptive Usher: assistant teacher with consumption (tuberculosis). </note> TO A GRAMMAR SCHOOL.)
The pale Usher—threadbare in coat, heart, body, and brain; I see him now.

He loved to dust his old grammars; it somehow mildly reminded him of his mortality.
