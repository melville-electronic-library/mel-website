THE PIPE

</p><p>WHEN Stubb had departed, Ahab stood for a while leaning over the bulwarks; and then, as had been usual with him of late, calling a sailor of the watch, he sent him below for his ivory stool, and also his pipe. Lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool on the weather side of the deck, he sat and smoked.

</p><p>In old <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:151" type="place">Norse</name> times, the thrones of the sea-loving <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:2" type="place">Danish</name> kings were fabricated, saith tradition, of the tusks of the narwhale.

Here have I been unconsciously toiling, not pleasuring,—aye, and ignorantly smoking to windward all the while; to windward, and with such nervous whiffs, as if, like the dying whale, my final jets were the strongest and fullest of trouble. What business have I with this pipe?

I’ll smoke no more—”

</p><p>He tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea. The fire hissed in the waves; the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe made. With slouched hat, Ahab lurchingly paced the planks.</p></body>
