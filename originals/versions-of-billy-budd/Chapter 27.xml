The silence at the moment of execution and for a moment or two  continuing thereafter, a silence but <orig regularizedText="emphasised">emphasized</orig> by the regular wash of the sea against the hull or the flutter of a sail caused by the helmsman&amp;apos;s eyes being tempted astray, this <orig regularizedText="emphasised">emphasized</orig> silence <ref target="#ref_30791"><orig regularizedText="was gradually was disturbed (double was in MS)">was gradually disturbed</orig></ref><note xml:id="ref_30791">was gradually disturbed] Originally, HM wrote that the helmsman "was presently disturbed." In a series of pencil revisions, he deleted "presently" (but not "was"), added a caret before "was," and inserted above the base line "this empasised silence was gradually," thereby unnecessarily repeating the word "was."  Assuming that HM intended to delete the base line "was," MEL emends by removing it.</note> by a sound not <orig regularizedText="easeily (MS)">easily</orig> to be verbally rendered.

The seeming remoteness of its source was because of its <orig regularizedText="murmerous (MS)">murmurous</orig> indistinctness since it came from close-by, even from the men massed on the ship&amp;apos;s open deck. <ref target="#ref_30066"><orig regularizedText="Being Inarticulate">Being inarticulate</orig></ref><note xml:id="ref_30066">Being inarticulate,] Before penciling "Before" in the margin, HM had capitalized "inarticulate" and did not undo the change after further revision.

But ere the <orig regularizedText="murmer (MS)">murmur</orig> had time to wax into clamor it was met by a stragetic command, the more telling that it came with abrupt unexpectedness:

For the remainder most of them were set to temporary employments connected with trimming the yards and so forth, business readily to be got up to serve occasion by any officer-of-the-deck.

However, authorial precedent for the singular "office" is found in the American version of Moby-Dick, Ch. 28: "If ever Captain Ahab should be tranquilly laid out ... then, whoever should do that last office for the dead, would find a birth-mark on him from crown to sole." Nor did HM's British editor of the The Whale change the word but published the singular form as well (see vol. 1, ch. 27).  Given HM's preference for "office," MEL retains his original wording in the singular.</note> of the sea-undertakers, the Sail-Maker&amp;apos;s Mates, were now speedily completed. When everything was in readiness a second call for all hands made necessary by the stragetic movement before mentioned was sounded and now to witness burial. 

</p><p>The details of this closing formality it needs not to give. But when the tilted plank let slide its freight into the sea, a second strange human <orig regularizedText="murmer (MS)">murmur</orig> was heard, blended now with another inarticulate sound proceeding from <ref target="#ref_30092">certain larger sea-fowl whose attention</ref><note xml:id="ref_30092">certain larger sea-fowl whose attention] In this lengthy and revised passage, HM makes the "attention" of the sea-fowl the subject of the verb "flew" (see the MS thumbnail for more details). NN claims that the revisions "left the syntax unsatisfactory," and adopts the copyedited phrase that first appeared in the HS text: "certain larger sea-fowl who, their attention having been attracted ... flew screaming to the spot" (HS 67; 431). MEL retains HM's sentence structure to signal that the subject-verb disagreement is closer to illogical than ungrammatical.</note> having been <pb facs="https://iip.textlab.org/?IIIF=mel/billybudd/modbm_ms_am_188_363_0753.tif" tl_leaf="https://app.textlab.org/transcriptions/17663"/>attracted by the peculiar commotion in the water resulting from the heavy sloped dive of the shotted <ref target="#ref_30095"><orig regularizedText="hammock, into the sea flew">hammock into the sea, flew</orig></ref><note xml:id="ref_30095">hammock into the sea, flew] HM added "into the sea" after "hammock," but did not reposition the comma after "hammock." MEL adds the comma after "sea" to retain the pause originally intended after "hammock."</note> screaming to the spot. So near the hull did they come, that the stridor or bony creak of their gaunt double-jointed pinions was audible. As the ship under light airs passed on, leaving the burial-spot astern, they still kept circling it low down with the moving shadow of their outstretched wings and the croaked requiem of their cries.

An uncertain movement began among them, in which some encroachment was made. It was tolerated but for a moment. For suddenly the drum beat to quarters, which familiar sound happening at least twice every day, had upon the present occasion a signal peremptoriness in it. True martial discipline long continued superinduces in average man a sort of <orig regularizedText="impulse docility [of omitted in MS]"><ref target="#ref_30409">impulse of docility</ref><note xml:id="ref_30409">impulse of docility] Originally, HM wrote "an instinct whose operation much resembles that of a natural one." In pencil, and in several steps, he revised to "a sort of impulse of docility whose operation much resembles the effect of an instinct."  However, in an intervening step, he considered revising "impulse of docility" by deleting "of" but did not apparently finish the revision. HS and NN read the resulting text—"impulse docility"—as two oscillating options, and they retain "impulse" only. MEL restores "of" and emends to "impulse of docility."

In due course the First Officer, sword under arm and standing in his place on the quarter-deck formally <orig regularizedText="recieved">received</orig> the successive reports of the sworded Lieutenants commanding the sections of batteries below; the last of which reports being made the summed report he delivered with the customary salute to the Commander. All this occupied time, which in the present case, was the object in beating to quarters at an <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1558035846406-q536nv7d35-7357207d4e4ee49cef7e0849b0a20aaa%2Fimg_759.png"/>hour prior to the customary one. That such variance from usage was <orig regularizedText="authorised">authorized</orig> by an officer like Captain Vere, a martinet as some deemed him, was evidence of the necessity for unusual action implied in what he deemed to be temporarily the mood of his men. &amp;quot;With <reg originalText="mankind[quote] (no comma in MS)">mankind,&amp;quot;</reg> he would <reg originalText="say (no comma in MS)">say,</reg> &amp;quot;forms, measured forms are everything; and that is the import couched in the story of Orpheus with his lyre spell-binding the wild denizens of the wood.&amp;quot; And this he once applied to the disruption of forms going on across the Channel and the <orig regularizedText="consequces">consequences</orig> thereof.  

</p><p>At this unwonted muster at quarters, all proceeded as at the regular hour. The band on the quarter-deck played a sacred <reg originalText="air.

That done, the drum beat the retreat; and toned by music and religious rites subserving the discipline <reg originalText="&amp;">and</reg> purposes of war, the men in their wonted orderly manner, dispersed to the places allotted them when not at the guns.

</p><p>And now it was full day. The fleece of low-hanging vapor had vanished, licked up by the sun that late had so glorified it. And the circumambient air in the clearness of its serenity was like smooth white marble in the polished block not yet removed from the marble-dealer&amp;apos;s yard.</p></body>
