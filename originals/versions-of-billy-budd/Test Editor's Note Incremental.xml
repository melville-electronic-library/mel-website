			<body><p><pb/>MEL&amp;apos;s edition of Herman Melville&amp;apos;s Billy Budd is the product of ten years of textual, digital, and scholarly work (2009-2019) performed by the team of editors and specialists listed at the end of this note. The edition, with others like it in the Editions section of the Melville Electronic Library website, follows protocols developed by John Bryant in The Fluid Text (Michigan 2002). A fluid text is any work that exists in multiple versions due to authorial, editorial, or adaptive revision. In MEL&amp;apos;s Billy Budd edition, our goal is to give readers access to a range of revisions related to the work. When fully realized, the edition will give readers digital access to the novella&amp;apos;s layered versions in manuscript and its twentieth-century print, stage, film, and musical versions. At present, the edition&amp;apos;s reading text—the central textual core of the project—represents Melville&amp;apos;s authorial revisions and MEL&amp;apos;s editorial alterations.</p></body>
