Passion, and passion in its profoundest, is not a thing demanding <ref target="#ref_28881">a</ref><note xml:id="ref_28881">a] a a (MS).

And the circumstances that provoke it, however trivial or mean, are no measure of its power. In the present instance the stage is a scrubbed gun-deck, and one of the external provocations a man-of-war&apos;s-man&apos;s spilled soup.  

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Now when the Master-at-arms noticed whence came that greasy fluid streaming before his feet, he must have taken it—to some extent wilfully, <pb facs="https://iip.textlab.org/?IIIF=mel/billybudd/modbm_ms_am_188_363_0348.tif" tl_leaf="https://app.textlab.org/transcriptions/15880"/>perhaps—not for the mere accident it assuredly was, but for the sly escape of a spontaneous feeling on Billy&apos;s part more or less answering to the antipathy on his own. In effect a foolish demonstration, he must have thought, and very harmless, like the futile kick of a heifer, which yet were <ref target="#ref_29862"><reg originalText="heifer (&quot;the&quot; in MS deleted)">the heifer</reg></ref><note xml:id="ref_29862">heifer] Melville wrote "the cow" first, crossed out the phrase, wrote "heifer" above the line, crossed it out, then restored it, not thinking to restore his deleted "the."</note> a shod stallion, would not be so harmless. Even so was it that into the gall of Claggart&apos;s envy he infused the vitriol of his contempt. <pb facs="https://iip.textlab.org/?IIIF=mel/billybudd/modbm_ms_am_188_363_0350.tif" tl_leaf="https://app.textlab.org/transcriptions/15884"/>But <reg originalText="The">the</reg> incident confirmed to him certain tell-tale reports purveyed to his ear by <hi rend="italic">Squeak</hi>, one of his more cunning Corporals, <ref target="#ref_28909">a</ref><note xml:id="ref_28909">a] a a (MS).

MEL deletes "the" so that the passage reads "underlying Claggart." But now "they" in the next sentence is ambiguous, "some natures" having been deleted.
