But after the little matter at the mess Billy Budd no more found himself in strange trouble at times about his hammock or his clothes-bag or what not. While, as to that smile that occasionally sunned him, and the pleasant passing word, these were if not more frequent, yet if anything more pronounced than before. 

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">But for all that, there were certain other demonstrations now. When Claggart&apos;s unobserved glance happened to <pb facs="https://iip.textlab.org/?IIIF=mel/billybudd/modbm_ms_am_188_363_0417.tif" tl_leaf="https://app.textlab.org/transcriptions/16035"/>light on belted Billy rolling along the upper gun-deck in the leisure of the second dog-watch exchanging passing broadsides of fun with other young promenaders in the crowd; that glance would follow the cheerful sea-Hyperion with <pb facs="https://iip.textlab.org/?IIIF=mel/billybudd/modbm_ms_am_188_363_0423.tif" tl_leaf="https://app.textlab.org/transcriptions/16041"/>a settled meditative and melancholy expression, his eyes strangely suffused with incipient feverish tears. Then would Claggart look like the man of sorrows. Yes, and sometimes the melancholy expression would have in it a touch of soft yearning, as if Claggart could even have loved Billy but <pb facs="https://iip.textlab.org/?IIIF=mel/billybudd/modbm_ms_am_188_363_0421.tif" tl_leaf="https://app.textlab.org/transcriptions/16039"/>for fate and ban. But this was an evanescence, and quickly repented of, as it were, by an immitigable look, pinching and <ref target="#ref_30026">shrivelling</ref><note xml:id="ref_30026">shrivelling] A common 19th-century spelling (OED).</note> the visage into the momentary semblence of a wrinkled walnut. <pb facs="https://iip.textlab.org/?IIIF=mel/billybudd/modbm_ms_am_188_363_0425.tif" tl_leaf="https://app.textlab.org/transcriptions/16043"/>But <reg originalText="Sometimes">sometimes</reg> catching sight in advance of the foretopman coming in his direction, he would, upon their nearing, step aside a little to let him pass, dwelling upon Billy for the moment with the glittering dental satire of a Guise. But upon any abrupt <orig regularizedText="unforseen">unforeseen</orig> encounter a red light <ref target="#ref_30029">would forth</ref><note xml:id="ref_30029">would forth] HM seems to have inadvertently omitted his verb, and a check mark in the left margin next to these two words suggests that HM (or his wife ESM) was aware of the problem. Accordingly, HS emends with "would flash forth." However, HM might have supplied any verb here, and since "forth" as a verb has precedence in medieval usage, MEL retains "would forth," as does NN.</note> from his eye like a spark from an anvil in a dusk smithy. <pb facs="https://iip.textlab.org/?IIIF=mel/billybudd/modbm_ms_am_188_363_0429.tif" tl_leaf="https://app.textlab.org/transcriptions/16019"/>That quick fierce light was a strange one, darted from orbs which in repose were of a color nearest approaching a deeper violet, the softest of shades. 

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><orig regularizedText="Tho&amp;#x27;">Though </orig>some of these caprices of the pit could not but be observed by their object, yet were they beyond the <orig regularizedText="construeing">construing</orig> of such a nature. <pb facs="https://iip.textlab.org/?IIIF=mel/billybudd/modbm_ms_am_188_363_0433.tif" tl_leaf="https://app.textlab.org/transcriptions/16049"/><orig regularizedText="the And">And</orig> the <ref target="#ref_30031">thews</ref><note xml:id="ref_30031">thews] In MS, ESM underlined HM's inscription of this word and added a question mark above it, presumably querying the word itself, its usage, or spelling.

He thought the Master-at-arms acted in a manner rather queer at times. That was all. But the occasional frank air and pleasant word went for what they purported to be, the young sailor never having heard as yet of the &quot;too fair-spoken man.&quot; <pb facs="https://iip.textlab.org/?IIIF=mel/billybudd/modbm_ms_am_188_363_0435.tif" tl_leaf="https://app.textlab.org/transcriptions/16051"/>

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Had the foretopman been conscious of having done or said anything to provoke the ill will of the official, it would have been different with him, and his sight might have been purged if not sharpened.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">So was it with him in yet another matter. Two minor officers–<ref target="#ref_28821">the Armorer and Captain</ref><note xml:id="ref_28821">the Armorer and Captain of the Hold] HM seems to vary in the number and names of the officers mentioned. Originally, he set up a series of "Certain minor officers" —"armorer, Captain of the Hold, and others"—however, he tentatively removed the "armorer" in pencil. Later, he then re-specified them as "two minor officers" and inserted "and" between the deleted "Armorer" (now capitalized) and "Captain." However, HM neglected to restore "Armorer." MEL restores this second officer, as do HS and NN.</note> of the Hold, with whom he had never exchanged a word, his position in the ship not bringing him into contact with them; these men now for the first began to cast upon Billy when they chanced to encounter him, that peculiar  <pb facs="https://iip.textlab.org/?IIIF=mel/billybudd/modbm_ms_am_188_363_0437.tif" tl_leaf="https://app.textlab.org/transcriptions/16055"/>glance which evidences that the man from whom it comes has been some way tampered with and to the prejudice of him upon whom the glance lights. Never did it occur to Billy as a thing to be noted or a thing suspicious, <orig regularizedText="tho&amp;#x27;">though</orig> he well knew the fact, that the Armorer and Captain of the Hold, with the ship&apos;s-yeoman, apothecary, and others of that grade, were by naval usage, messmates of the master-at-arms, men with ears convenient to his confidential tongue<orig regularizedText=";">.</orig>   <pb facs="https://iip.textlab.org/?IIIF=mel/billybudd/modbm_ms_am_188_363_0439.tif" tl_leaf="https://app.textlab.org/transcriptions/16059"/>

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">As to the afterguardsman, <orig regularizedText="tho&amp;#x27;">though</orig> Billy for reasons already given necessarily saw little of him, yet when the two did happen to meet, invariably came the fellow&apos;s off-hand cheerful recognition, sometimes accompanied by a passing pleasant word or two. Whatever that equivocal young person&apos;s original design may really have been, or the design of which he might have been the <orig regularizedText="deputy (no comma in MS)">deputy,</orig> certain it was from his manner upon these occasions, that he had wholly dropped it. <pb facs="https://iip.textlab.org/?IIIF=mel/billybudd/modbm_ms_am_188_363_0443.tif" tl_leaf="https://app.textlab.org/transcriptions/16067"/>

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">It was as if his precocity of crookedness (and every vulgar <orig regularizedText="villian">villain</orig> is precocious) had for once deceived him, and the man he had sought to entrap as a simpleton, had through his very simplicity ignominiously baffled him.   

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">But shrewd ones may opine that it was hardly possible for Billy to refrain from going up to the afterguardsman and bluntly demanding to know his purpose in the initial interview so abruptly closed in the fore-chains. Shrewd ones may also think it but natural in Billy to set about <pb facs="https://iip.textlab.org/?IIIF=mel/billybudd/modbm_ms_am_188_363_0445.tif" tl_leaf="https://app.textlab.org/transcriptions/16071"/>sounding some of the other impressed men of the ship in order to discover what basis, if any, there was for the emissary&apos;s obscure suggestions as to plotting disaffection aboard. Yes, <ref target="#ref_30041"><orig regularizedText="shrewd may so so think">any shrewd one may so think</orig></ref><note xml:id="ref_30041">any shrewd one may so think] Melville wrote "any shrewd one would so think," then deleted "any" and "one," inscribing "may so" above the line. The resulting text of this uncompleted revision is "shrewd may so so think." MEL emends the obvious double wording to "so." However, the uncompleted revision text "shrewd" poses a problem. In his paragraph, HM's repetition of "shrewd ones" establishes a pattern of plurals, but in the original text of his new sentence his singular subject—"any shrewd one"—indicates a strategic breaking of the plural pattern. HM's subsequent deletion of "any" and "one" is ambiguous: it might indicate an intention to return to the plural, or an intention to find an alternative singular form (such as "a shrewd one," etc.). As it stands, the revision site oscillates between plural and singular possibilities. HS and NN emend with "shrewd ones," thereby reinforcing the plural. MEL emends by restoring the singular "any shrewd one."</note>. But something more, or rather, something else than mere shrewdness is perhaps needful for the due understanding of such a character as Billy Budd&apos;s.  <pb facs="https://iip.textlab.org/?IIIF=mel/billybudd/modbm_ms_am_188_363_0447.tif" tl_leaf="https://app.textlab.org/transcriptions/16075"/>

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">As to Claggart, the monomania in the man—if that indeed it were—as involuntarily disclosed by starts in the manifestations detailed, yet in general covered over by his self-contained and rational demeanor; this, like a subterranean fire was eating its way deeper and deeper in him. Something decisive must come of it.</p></div></body>
