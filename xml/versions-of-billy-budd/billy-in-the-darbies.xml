Good of the Chaplain to enter Lone Bay  
And down on his marrow-bones here and pray  
For the likes just o&apos; me, Billy Budd.—But, look:  
Through the port comes the moon-shine astray!  
It tips the guard&apos;s <orig regularizedText="cutlas">cutlass</orig> and silvers this nook;  
But &apos;twill die in the dawning of Billy&apos;s last day.   
A jewel-block they&apos;ll make of me tomorrow,   
Pendant pearl from the yard-arm-end  
Like the ear-drop I gave to Bristol Molly— <pb facs="https://iip.textlab.org/?IIIF=mel/billybudd/modbm_ms_am_188_363_0791.tif" tl_leaf="https://app.textlab.org/transcriptions/17622"/>
O, &apos;tis me, not the sentence they&apos;ll suspend.  
Ay, Ay, all is up; and I must up too  
Early in the morning, aloft from alow.
On an empty stomach now never it would do.   
They&apos;ll give me a nibble—bit o&apos; <orig regularizedText="buiscit">biscuit</orig> ere I go.  
Sure, a messmate will reach me the last parting cup;
But, turning heads away from the hoist and the belay,  
Heaven knows who will have the running of me up!
No pipe to those halyards.—But aren&apos;t it all sham?
A blur&apos;s in my eyes; it is dreaming that I am.  
A hatchet to my <orig regularizedText="hauzer">hawser</orig>? all adrift to go? <pb facs="https://iip.textlab.org/?IIIF=mel/billybudd/modbm_ms_am_188_363_0793.tif" tl_leaf="https://app.textlab.org/transcriptions/17621"/>
The drum roll to grog, and Billy never know?
But Donald he has promised to stand by the plank;
So I&apos;ll shake a friendly hand ere I sink.
But—no! It is dead then I&apos;ll be, come to think.—
I remember Taff the Welshman when he sank.
And his cheek it was like the budding pink
But me they&apos;ll lash me in hammock, drop me deep. <pb facs="https://iip.textlab.org/?IIIF=mel/billybudd/modbm_ms_am_188_363_0795.tif" tl_leaf="https://app.textlab.org/transcriptions/17620"/>
Fathoms down, fathoms down, how I&apos;ll dream fast asleep.  
I feel it stealing now. Sentry, are you there? 
Just ease <orig regularizedText="this"><ref target="#ref_30172">these</ref><note xml:id="ref_30172">HM had "this iron," then "shackles," before settling on "darbies," but he neglected to modify "this" accordingly.</note></orig> darbies at the wrist, 
and roll me over fair,  
I am sleepy, and the oozy weeds about me twist.</p></div></body>
