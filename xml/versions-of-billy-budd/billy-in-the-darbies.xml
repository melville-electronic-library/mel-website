Good of the Chaplain to enter Lone Bay  
And down on his marrow-bones here and pray  
For the likes just o' me, Billy Budd.—But, look:  
Through the port comes the moon-shine astray!  
It tips the guard's <choice ><orig>cutlas</orig><reg>cutlass</reg></choice> and silvers this nook;  
But 'twill die in the dawning of Billy's last day.   
A jewel-block they'll make of me tomorrow,   
Pendant pearl from the yard-arm-end  
Like the ear-drop I gave to Bristol Molly— <pb facs="https://iip.textlab.org/?IIIF=mel/billybudd/modbm_ms_am_188_363_0791.tif" tl_leaf="https://app.textlab.org/transcriptions/17622"/>
O, 'tis me, not the sentence they'll suspend.  
Ay, Ay, all is up; and I must up too  
Early in the morning, aloft from alow.
On an empty stomach now never it would do.   
They'll give me a nibble—bit o' <choice ><orig>buiscit</orig><reg>biscuit</reg></choice> ere I go.  
Sure, a messmate will reach me the last parting cup;
But, turning heads away from the hoist and the belay,  
Heaven knows who will have the running of me up!
No pipe to those halyards.—But aren't it all sham?
A blur's in my eyes; it is dreaming that I am.  
A hatchet to my <choice ><orig>hauzer</orig><reg>hawser</reg></choice>? all adrift to go? <pb facs="https://iip.textlab.org/?IIIF=mel/billybudd/modbm_ms_am_188_363_0793.tif" tl_leaf="https://app.textlab.org/transcriptions/17621"/>
The drum roll to grog, and Billy never know?
But Donald he has promised to stand by the plank;
So I'll shake a friendly hand ere I sink.
But—no! It is dead then I'll be, come to think.—
I remember Taff the Welshman when he sank.
And his cheek it was like the budding pink
But me they'll lash me in hammock, drop me deep. <pb facs="https://iip.textlab.org/?IIIF=mel/billybudd/modbm_ms_am_188_363_0795.tif" tl_leaf="https://app.textlab.org/transcriptions/17620"/>
Fathoms down, fathoms down, how I'll dream fast asleep.  
I feel it stealing now. Sentry, are you there? 
Just ease <choice ><orig>this</orig><reg><ref xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" target="#ref_30172">these</ref><note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="ref_30172">HM had "this iron," then "shackles," before settling on "darbies," but he neglected to modify "this" accordingly.</note></reg></choice> darbies at the wrist, 
and roll me over fair,  
I am sleepy, and the oozy weeds about me twist.</p></div></body>
