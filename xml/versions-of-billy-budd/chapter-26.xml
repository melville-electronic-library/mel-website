<hi rend="italic">A digression</hi> 

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">When some days afterwards in reference to the singularity just mentioned, the <reg originalText="Purser [no comma]">Purser,</reg> a rather ruddy rotund person more accurate as an accountant than profound as a philosopher, said at mess to the Surgeon, &amp;quot;What testimony to the force lodged in <reg originalText="will-power [no comma]">will-power,</reg>&amp;quot; the latter saturnine spare and tall, one in whom a discreet causticity went along with a manner less genial than polite, replied, &amp;quot;Your pardon, Mr. Purser. In a hanging scientifically conducted—and under special orders I myself directed how Budd&apos;s was to be effected—any movement following the completed suspension and originating in the body suspended, such movement indicates <pb facs="https://iip.textlab.org/?IIIF=mel/billybudd/modbm_ms_am_188_363_0737.tif" tl_leaf="https://app.textlab.org/transcriptions/17634"/>mechanical spasm in the muscular system. Hence the <orig regularizedText="abscence">absence</orig> of that is no more attributable to will-power as you call it than to horse-power—begging your pardon.&amp;quot; 

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">&amp;quot;But this muscular spasm you speak of, is not that in a degree more or less invariable in these cases?&amp;quot; 

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">&amp;quot;Assuredly so, Mr. Purser.&amp;quot;  

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">&amp;quot;How then, my good sir, do you account for its absence in this <reg originalText="instance?">instance?&amp;quot;</reg> 

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">&amp;quot;Mr. Purser, it is clear that your sense of the singularity in this matter equals not mine. You account for it by what you call <reg originalText="will-power [no comma]">will-power,</reg> a term not yet included in the lexicon of science. For me I do not, <pb facs="https://iip.textlab.org/?IIIF=mel/billybudd/modbm_ms_am_188_363_0739.tif" tl_leaf="https://app.textlab.org/transcriptions/17636"/>with my present knowledge pretend to account for it at all. Even should we assume the hypothesis that at the first touch of the halyards the action of Budd&apos;s heart intensified by extraordinary emotion at its climax, abruptly stopt—much like a watch when in carelessly winding it up you strain at the finish, thus snapping the chain—even under that hypothesis how acount for the phenomenon that followed.&amp;quot;  

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">&amp;quot;You admit then that the absence of spasmodic movement was <orig regularizedText="phenominal">phenomenal</orig>.&amp;quot;  

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">It was <orig regularizedText="phenominal">phenomenal</orig>, Mr. Purser, in the sense that it was an appearance <pb facs="https://iip.textlab.org/?IIIF=mel/billybudd/modbm_ms_am_188_363_0741.tif" tl_leaf="https://app.textlab.org/transcriptions/17638"/>the cause of which is not <orig regularizedText="immediatly">immediately</orig> to be assigned.&amp;quot;

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><reg originalText="But">&amp;quot;But</reg> tell me, my dear <reg originalText="Sir,">Sir,&amp;quot;</reg> pertinaciously continued the other, &amp;quot;was the man&apos;s death effected by the halter, or was it a species of euthanasia?  

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">&amp;quot;<hi rend="italic">Euthanasia</hi>, Mr. Purser, is something like your <hi rend="italic">will-power</hi>: I doubt its authenticity as a scientific term—begging your pardon again. It is at once imaginative and metaphysical,—in short, Greek. But&amp;quot; abruptly changing his tone &amp;quot;there is a case in the sick-bay that I do not care to leave to my assistants. Beg your pardon, but excuse me.&amp;quot; And rising from the mess he formally withdrew.</p></div></body>
