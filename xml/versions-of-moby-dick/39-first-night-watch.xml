<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">HA! ha! ha! ha! hem! clear my throat!—I’ve been thinking over it ever since, and that ha, ha’s the final consequence. Why so? Because a laugh’s the wisest, easiest answer to all that’s queer; and come what will, one comfort’s always left—that unfailing comfort is, it’s all predestinated. I heard not all his talk with Starbuck; but to my poor eye Starbuck then looked something as I the other evening felt. Be sure the old <ref target="#ref_16595">Mogul</ref><note xml:id="ref_16595">Mogul: Mongol ruler.</note> has fixed him, too. I twigged it, knew it; had had the gift, might readily have prophesied it—for when I clapped my eye upon his skull I saw it. Well, Stubb, wise Stubb—that’s my title—well, Stubb, what of it, Stubb? Here’s a <ref target="#ref_16596">carcase</ref><note xml:id="ref_16596">carcase: Variant of carcass, corpse; also “the decaying skeleton of a vessel . . . a ruin” (OED). Evoking the grave-digger scene in which Hamlet contemplates a skull, Stubb, who has just mentioned a skull, calls himself in a dismissively witty tone just a carcase, or anything (according to the OED) “from which the life, soul or essence is gone.”</note>. I know not all that may be coming, but be it what it will, I’ll go to it laughing. Such a waggish leering as lurks in all your horribles! I feel funny. Fa, la! lirra, skirra! What’s my juicy little pear at home doing now? Crying its eyes out?—Giving a party to the last arrived harpooneers, I dare say, gay as a <ref target="#ref_21268">frigate’s pennant</ref><note xml:id="ref_21268">Flag flown at the top of the mainmast on a frigate, or warship.

	To love, as gay and fleeting
As bubbles that swim, on the beaker’s brim,
	And break on the lips while meeting.
