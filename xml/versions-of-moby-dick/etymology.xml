<head type="sub-head">(SUPPLIED BY A LATE <ref target="#ref_19450">CONSUMPTIVE USHER</ref><note xml:id="ref_19450">Consumptive Usher: assistant teacher with consumption (tuberculosis). </note> TO A GRAMMAR SCHOOL.)</head>
<p>The pale Usher—threadbare in coat, heart, body, and brain; I see him now. He was ever dusting his old lexicons and grammars, with a queer handkerchief, mockingly embellished with all the gay flags of all the known nations of the world. He loved to dust his old grammars; it somehow mildly reminded him of his mortality.
