Faith Barrett claims that Melville was “torn between a desire to critique nationalist poetry and a desire for the consolations that a nationalist poetry might offer.” [Critical]</note>
Are pledge that they shall ever live renowned;
               Such seems to be
A Frigate&apos;s name (by present glory spanned)—
               The <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/artwork:908" type="artwork">Cumberland</name>.
                                                                                     
                                  Sounding name as ere was sung,
                                  Flowing, rolling on the tongue—
                                  Cumberland! Cumberland!
                                                                                     
She <ref target="#ref_20996">warred and sunk</ref><note xml:id="ref_20996">In the same waters where the Cumberland retained its flag, the naval ship with the symbolic name the USS United States -- on which Melville had served and written about in White-Jacket -- had earlier been scuttled to prevent it getting in the hands of the Confederates. </note>. There&apos;s no denying
    That she was ended—quelled;
And yet her flag above her fate is flying,
              As when it swelled
Unswallowed by the swallowing sea: so grand—
              The Cumberland.

                                 Roundly rolling on the tongue—
                                 Cumberland! Cumberland!
                                                                                                      
What need to tell how she was fought—
    The sinking flaming gun—
The gunner leaping out the port—
              Washed back, undone!
Her dead unconquerably manned
              The Cumberland.
                                                                                      
                                  Noble name as ere was sung,
                                  Slowly roll it on the tongue—
                                  Cumberland! Cumberland!
                                                                                     
Long as hearts shall share the flame
    Which burned in that brave crew,
Her fame shall live—outlive the victor&apos;s name;
              For this is due.
Your flag and flag-staff shall in story stand—
              Cumberland!
                                                                                     
                                   Sounding name as ere was sung,
                                   Long they&apos;ll roll it on the tongue—
                                   Cumberland! Cumberland!
