imparted by the fall of Richmond. They were composed without reference to
collective arrangement, but, being brought together in review, naturally fall into
the order assumed.

</p><p>The events and incidents of the conflict—making up a whole, in varied amp-
litude, corresponding with the geographical area covered by the war—from
these but a few themes have been taken, such as for any cause chanced to im-
print themselves upon the mind.

</p><p>The aspects which the strife as a memory assumes are as manifold as are the
moods of involuntary meditation—moods variable, and at times widely at vari-
ance. Yielding instinctively, one after another, to feelings not inspired from
any one source exclusively, and unmindful, without purposing to be, of consis-
tency, I seem, in most of these verses, to have but placed a harp in a window,
and noted the contrasted airs which wayward winds have played upon the
strings.]
