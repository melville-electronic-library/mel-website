(June, 1865)

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Armies he&apos;s seen—the herds of war,
  But never such swarms of men
As now in the <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:37" type="place"><ref target="#ref_20917"><name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:333" type="place">Nineveh</name> of the North</ref><note xml:id="ref_20917">[Allusion] New York City</note></name>—
  How mad the Rebellion then!

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">And yet but dimly he divines
  The depth of that deceit,
And superstition of vast pride
  Humbled to such defeat.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Seductive shone the Chiefs in arms—
  His steel the nearest magnet drew;
Wreathed with its kind, the Gulf-weed drives—
  &apos;Tis Nature&apos;s wrong they rue.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">His face is hidden in his beard,
  But his heart peers out at eye—
<pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1495041004073-avojh0ee5vs-bdc958479b9e4d5b46dc387f8d849f47%2Fbattle-pieces-ii-0161.jpg"/>And such a heart! like a mountain-pool
  Where no man passes by.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">He thinks of <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:378" type="person">Hill</name>—a brave soul gone;
  And <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:379" type="person">Ashby</name> dead in pale disdain;
And <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:380" type="person">Stuart</name> with the <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:381" type="person">Rupert</name>-plume,
  Whose blue eye never shall laugh again.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">He hears the drum; he sees our boys
  From his wasted fields return;
Ladies feast them on strawberries,
  And even to kiss them yearn.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">He marks them bronzed, in soldier-trim,
  The rifle proudly borne;
They bear it for an heir-loom home,
  And he—disarmed—jail-worn.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Home, home—his heart is full of it;
  But home he never shall see,
Even should he stand upon the spot;
  &apos;Tis gone!—where his brothers be.<pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1495041629359-jcrtsr6rwzd-bdc958479b9e4d5b46dc387f8d849f47%2Fbattle-pieces-ii-0162.jpg"/>The cypress-moss from tree to tree
  Hangs in his Southern land;
As weird, from thought to thought of his
  Run memories hand in hand.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">And so he lingers—lingers on
  In the City of the Foe—
His cousins and his countrymen
  Who see him listless go.
