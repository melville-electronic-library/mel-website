    A bugle wails the long recall;
Derision stirs the deep abyss,
    Heaven&apos;s ominous silence over all.
Return, return, O eager Hope,
    And face man&apos;s latter fall.
Events, they make the dreamers quail;
Satan&apos;s old age is strong and hale,
A disciplined captain, gray in skill,
And <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:230" type="person">Raphael</name> a white enthusiast still;
Dashed aims, at which <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:130" type="person">Christ</name>&apos;s martyrs pale,

    To faith alike are vain;
Though <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/event:50" type="event">comets</name>, gone a thousand years,

Patient she stands—she can no more—

Surges, and heaps Time&apos;s strand with wrecks.

    The thing they will they bring to pass,
And prosper to the apoplex.
The rout it herds around the heart,

Kings wag their heads—Now save thyself
