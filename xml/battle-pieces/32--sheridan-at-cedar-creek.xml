Read's first also stanza describes Sheridan hearing the guns and realizing the battle had begun anew. 
(Eric Meckley) </note>—
      Miles away;
When he heard them calling, calling—
    Mount! nor stay:
      Quick, or all is lost;
      They&apos;ve surprised and stormed the post,
      They push your routed host—
  Gallop! retrieve the day.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">House the horse in ermine—
  For the foam-flake blew
White through the red October;
  He thundered into view;
They cheered him in the looming,
  Horseman and horse they knew.
      The turn of the tide began,
      The rally of bugles ran,
      He swung his hat in the van;
  The electric hoof-spark flew.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Wreathe the steed and lead him—
  For the charge he led
Touched and turned the cypress
  Into amaranths for the head
Of <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:115" type="person">Philip</name>, king of riders,
  Who raised them from the dead.
      The camp (at dawning lost),
      By eve, recovered—forced,
      Rang with laughter of the host
  At belated <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:175" type="person">Early</name> fled.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Shroud the horse in sable—
  For the mounds they heap!
There is firing in the <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:446" type="place">Valley</name>,
  And yet no strife they keep;
It is the parting volley,
  It is the pathos deep.
      There is glory for the brave
      Who lead, and nobly save,
      But no knowledge in the grave
  Where the nameless followers sleep.
