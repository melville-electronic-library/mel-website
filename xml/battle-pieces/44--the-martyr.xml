<p>At this period of excitement the thought was by some passionately welcomed that the Presidential successor had been raised up by heaven to wreak vengeance on the South. The idea originated in the remembrance that Andrew Johnson by birth belonged to that class of Southern whites who never cherished love for the dominant one; that he was a citizen of Tennessee, where the contest at times and in places had been close and bitter as a Middle-Age feud; that himself and family had been hardly treated by the Secessionists.</p><p>But the expectations built hereon (if, indeed, ever soberly entertained), happily for the country, have not been verified.</p><p>Likewise the feeling which would have held the entire South chargeable with the crime of one exceptional assassin, this too has died away with the natural excitement of the hour.

[Criticism—Canonical] In his own copy of Battle-Pieces, Melville drew a line through the poem’s title. Howard P. Vincent argues that Melville did so “probably feeling that is [sic] was inflammatory and provocative” and not conducive to national healing (456).
[Criticism—recent] [Intertextuality] Robillard prompts readers to compare Melville’s poem on Lincoln’s assassination to Walt Whitman’s “When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom’d” and “O Captain! My Captain!” (189).

[Allusion—biblical] the “Passion” refers to the “last suffering of the Savior” (Webster), i.e. the physical, psychological, and spiritual suffering endured by Jesus from the Last Supper to his death; his Crucifixion.

[Intratextuality] Cohen points to Battle-Pieces poem “The Scout Toward Aldie” as another example of Melville’s “use of ballad conventions” (266).
