Garner cites Hawthorne's private musing that "If Emerson chooses to plant John Brown's gallows on Mount Calvery, the moral and religious sense of mankind will insist on its being placed between the crosses of the two thieves, and not side by side with that of the Savior" (46). This is a fairly clear indictment of the views of Brown as a Christ figure. Yet, Melville makes strong allusions to Christ in the poem. Melville may be expressing, as Garner believes, a mixture of alarm and admiration for Brown's actions (46).</note>,

Cohen connects Brown's words with Shakespeare and the notion of royalty. 

It may also be that Melville is prompting us here to think about the wounds on Christ's head from the crown of thorns and the wound on his side from the Roman centurion.</note> shall heal no more.</hi><ref target="#ref_20364">(<ref target="#ref_20373">such the <ref target="#ref_20965">law</ref><note xml:id="ref_20965">The use of law is ambiguous, referring both to physical and civil laws.(Shurr, 17) [Ambiguity]</note></ref><note xml:id="ref_20373">[Criticism: Canonical][Intertextuality] Hennig Cohen connects Brown's hanging with that of Billy Budd.

Hidden in the <ref target="#ref_20378"><ref target="#ref_20368">cap</ref><note xml:id="ref_20368">[Ambiguity]  The word “cap” refers first to brown’s hat, which covered his wound, but the word also cuts down “capital” and “capitol,”  both from the Latin word caput, which means “head.” Melville likely references classical and imperial contexts, especially the most ponderous neo-classical symbol in the book, the “Iron Dome” of the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C., which was notably completed in the same year as Melville published Battle-Pieces. See line 44 in “The Conflict of Convictions” for the first use of this symbol, and note x there.  In the pun on “capitol,” Melville extends Brown’s physical pain from the cut on his “crown’ (see note x above] to the deeply personal, moral “anguish” over slavery that drove Brown to take his radical action. Moreover, Melville suggests that the nation’s moral wound at the time of Harper’s Ferry remains “hidden” in the constitution of federal power, as represented symbolically by the Capitol dome. If he wrote the poem late in his process of making the book, and it serves “as a preface to the other poems,” as Cohen writes, then the “anguish” “hidden” in the newly completed “cap”-itol dome may be allusive of future national trauma as well (201).  </note></ref><note xml:id="ref_20378">[Poetics:Rhyme] The word “draw” may be a perfect rhyme with “law” and “Shenandoah” if, according to William H. Shurr, these words pick up on Melville’s own “regional pronunciation” (NN 625, Shurr 16). Alternately, the word “draw” may be an example of an imperfect rhyme.  See Cohen for extended discussion of Melville’s deployment of irregular rhyme scheme in “The Portent” (203).</note><hi rend="italic"><name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:119" type="person">Hidden</name> in the cap

Moreover, in the 1860s medicinal blood-letting was uncommon but still practiced, and Melville may be alluding to Brown’s blood-letting as a failed attempt to “draw”-out or expurgate the nation’s  slavery- induced sickness. </note></ref><note xml:id="ref_20369">[Allusion] Cohen remarks that “[t]he imagery of the poem is predominantly visual and much of it derives from the human body” (203).  He also tells us that “draw” means to “remove so as to disclose, with a veil; portray, delineate” (205). The word “draw” may indirectly allude to the many artistic portrayals of John Brown available to readers by the time the poem was published. See the note x above for several of the images of Brown available to Melville in his time and another primary source, the Rebellion Record, as he composed the poem. </note>;

See note x on the title page. It is significant in a book so given to portraits that the prefatory poem, or proem, ponders in some depth the aspect of a prophetic figure.  </note>,
