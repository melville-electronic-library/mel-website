Although Melville doesn't mark the two passages in his Bible, he would have known the temptation of Jesus in the wilderness: Christ standing upon the highest point of the Holy Temple (Matthew 4.5; Luke 4.9). Battle-Pieces contains numerous allusions to John Milton. In Paradise Regained, we have Christ standing on the "Temple...of alabaster, topt with golden spires" (4.546; 547). In this spiritual battle between Jesus and Satan, the Son of God is tempted with kingdoms and tasked to stand firmly upon a precipice. Christ's ability to stand--to not fall--is part of his triumph over Satan. Thus, if the spire has fallen, there can be no more room for Christ to stand and withstand the temptations of Satan.</note> crashing in the town,</l>

						<note xml:id="ref_20501">[Criticism: Canonical] [Intratextuality] Cohen notes Melville's use of fair and foul in the description of the soldier's eye in " The Scout Toward Aldie " (206). Melville writes, "And looked the Soldier in the eye— / A glance of mingled foul and fair."</note>
						<note xml:id="ref_20484">[Ambiguity] There are a few ways to interpret Melville's understanding of "man's foulest crime." Throughout the Melville canon, we find situations that bring us back to the question posed in Genesis 4.9: "Am I my brother's keeper?" It may be that Melville is thinking of fratricide, and of how we continually revisit these themes throughout history. For Melville, slavery would certainly fall in this category. Additionally, the foul crime of fratricide may explain the world's fairest hope. As it became more apparent that the country was heading for war, it may have entered Melville's mind that fratricide might be the only solution. Thus, "the world's fairest hope linked with man's foulest crime."</note>
