<l><ref target="#EDnoteFortitudeRN1"><hi rend="smallcaps">They</hi> take no shame</ref><note xml:id="EDnoteFortitudeRN1">In his bound sheets of <hi rend="italic">Battle-Pieces</hi> (Copy C), Melville used pencil to create a wavy line around and between "They take" and "no shame" to indicate a transposition of these words to give "No shame they take," a syntactical inversion typical in traditional balladic verse and common in Melville's style. Melville makes a similar transposition in "The Scout toward Aldie," revising "They leave the road" to "The road they leave." The editors of the NN <hi rend="italic">Published Poems</hi> emend their reading text by performing both transpositions for Melville. In keeping with our protocol of not mixing versions of a work, MEL does not emend, but notes Melville's changes through revision annotation.</note> for dark defeat <pb facs="/images/battle-pieces-v2/battle-pieces-ii-0177.jpg"/></l>

	<note>Note 2: [Critical][Intratextual] This poem, along with the previous poem ”Inscription" focuses on Right and Cause, part of “a constellation of values associated with Law in Melville’s mind” (Shurr 17). (Christina Lee)

<!--
<note>Note 1: [Historical] There is disagreement about which Cape “Cape-of-Storms” refers to. Cohen suggests that “Cape-of-Storms” refers to Cape Horn since “[f]or Melville Cape Horn is often a symbol of anguish and trial” and he points to references in Melville’s letters, journal entries and White-Jacket (Cohen 206-207, 280); more recently, however, Monteiro argues that “Cape-of-Storms” refers to Cape of Good Hope, which was originally named Cape of Storms and points to references in Moby-Dick and White-Jacket (Monteiro 55).
