<note xml:id="ref_21156">REVISION NARRATIVE: <p>Melville revised lines 91-92 in several stages, before and after the version seen here. In all versions, Melville's wording addresses the necessity and severity of Sherman's still-questioned "scorched earth" policy.  In the <hi rend="italic">Harper's New Monthly Magazine</hi> version, Melville presents line 91 as a flat, matter-of-fact statement and puts line 92 in parentheses as a kind of laconic aside: “It was Treason’s retribution / (Necessity the plea);”. The implication is that the "terror" of "retribution" can be justified. In the <hi rend="italic">Battle-Pieces</hi> version, Melville converts the two lines into a single question: "Was it Treason's retribution— / Necessity the plea?", thereby implying some kind of negative judgment. However, in his Copy C, Melville penciled a thorough revision.  First, in light pencil he inscribed two new lines in the blank bottom half of the page, circled the lines, and drew an insertion line up the left margin to an "x" inscribed next to line 92; he also deleted both lines in light pencil. Then, Melville's wife, Elizabeth Shaw Melville, erased the new lines (beyond legibility), the circle, and insertion line (though not the "x") and, in darker pencil, deleted lines 91-92, reinscribed over the erased lines two lines (presumably the same as those erased), and retraced the insertion line adding an arrow point. The revision lines are "Was the havoc, retribution? / But howsoe'er it be," with the second line no longer being part of the first line's question but rather serving now as an introduction to the stanza's final lines and the end of the poem.
</p>
<p>As noted below, Melville's "necessity" line (sacrificed in his third version) is an echo of Satan's excuse making in Milton's <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>. However, Melville's use of "havoc" in his third revision has a Shakespearean echo. Today, we take "havoc" to mean general chaos and destruction, but, according to the OED, "havoc" was originally a battle order giving combatants license to pillage and take spoils. Thus, Marc Antony imagines the ghost of Caesar seeking vengenace with "Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war." While Melville's use of "havoc" (followed by a rhetorical comma urging the reader to pause) seems a harsh judgment of Sherman's military decision to unleash his "dogs of war" on the populace, Melville's "Howso'er it be," apart from removing an association with Satan, deflates the implied judgment.

  (Shall gnats impede the bull?)</ref><note xml:id="ref_21136">THEY BRUSHED THE FOE...IMPEDE THE BULL [Allusion—historical—military] Sherman’s troops were in greater numbers and better supply than Confederate forces that attempted to rout the Federals on the march. Even the substantive Confederate force, Joseph Wheeler’s cavalry, hardly posed a threat to Sherman’s men. One small Confederate militia under the command of Brig. General Pleasant J. Phillips engaged Sherman’s rear guard near Griswoldville, GA on November 22. The Confederates were decimated in the skirmish; Union soldiers discovered afterward that Phillips’s troops were primarily young boys and elderly men (“Scorched Earth,” www.civilwar.org).

note xml:id="ref_21155">FOR BEHIND...MANIACS RAN [Allusion—military] William T. Sherman’s Special Field Orders, No. 120, indicates: “In districts and neighborhoods where the army is unmolested, no destruction of such property should be permitted; but should guerrillas or bushwhackers molest our march, or should the inhabitants burn bridges, obstruct roads, or other-wise manifest local hostility, then army commanders should order and enforce a devastation more or less relentless, according to the measure of such hostility” (The War of the Rebellion, 713).

<ref target="#ref_21135">The foragers</ref><note xml:id="ref_21135">THE FORAGERS [Allusion—military] In his Special Field Orders, No. 120, Sherman determined “[t]he army will forage liberally on the country during the march” (The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, Series 1-Vol 39, 713). A selection of soldiers were organized as foragers to search out food and goods from plantations, modest homesteads, and slave cabins alike. These foragers earned the name “bummers” (“Scorched Earth,” www.civilwar.org).

<ref target="#ref_21152">Where rolled savannas lay</ref><note xml:id="ref_21152">SAVANNAS [Allusion—geographical] A reference to Savannah, GA, where Sherman ended his march.
[Denotation] Melville’s 1846 copy of Webster’s dictionary defines “savanna” as “[a]n extensive, open plain or meadow, or a plain destitute of trees.”
[Intratextuality] In “The Armies of the Wilderness,” Melville refers to the Pampas grasslands of South America, which include the Uruguayan Savanna east of the Parana River: “(Turned adrift into war / Man runs wild on the plain, / Like the jennets let loose / On the Pampas—zebras again.).

<ref target="#ref_21153">And they helped themselves from farm-lands</ref><note xml:id="ref_21153">[Allusion—military] From William T. Sherman’s Special Field Orders, No. 120: “4. The army will forage liberally on the country during the march. To this end, each brigade commander will organize a good and sufficient foraging party, under the command of one or more discreet officers, who will gather, near the route traveled, corn or forage of any kind, meat of any kind, vegetables, corn-meal, or whatever is needed by the command, aiming at all times to keep the wagons at least ten days’ provisions for his command, and three days’ forage. Soldiers must not enter the dwellings of the inhabitants, or commit any trespass; but, during a halt or camp, they may be permitted to gather turnips, potatoes, and other vegetables, and to drive in stock in sight of their camp. To regular foraging-parties must be intrusted the gathering of provisions and forage at any distance from the road traveled” (The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, 713).

From Sherman’s report: “I estimate the damage done to the State of Georgia and its military resources at one hundred millions of dollars; at least twenty millions of which has inured to our advantage, and the remainder is simple waste and destruction. This may be a hard species of warfare, but it brings the sad realities of war home to those to who have been directly or indirectly instrumental in involving us in its attendant calamities” (qtd. in appendix to Nichols’s The Story of the Great March, 235).</note>:

As for horses, mules, wagons, etc., belonging to the inhabitants, the cavalry and artillery may appropriate freely and without limit; discriminating, however, between the rich, who are usually hostile and the poor and industrious, usually neutral or friendly. Foraging-parties may also take mules or horses, to replace the jaded animals of their trains, or to serve as pack-mules for the regiments or brigades” (652).
Also, in Sherman’s Report of the Georgia Campaign, published in the appendix of George Nichols’s The Story of the Great March, Sherman notes: “We have also consumed the corn and fodder in the region of country thirty miles on either side of a line from Atlanta to Savannah, as also the sweet potatoes, cattle, hogs, sheep, and poultry, and have carried away more than ten thousand horses and mules, as well as a countless number of their slaves” (235).

There is not a regiment nor a company, not a teamster nor a negro at headquarters, nor an orderly, but has a ‘rooster’ of one kind or another. When the column is moving, these haughty game-cocks are seen mounted upon the breech of a cannon, tied to the pack-saddle of a mule, among pots and pans, or carried lovingly in the arms of a mounted orderly; crowing with all his might from the interior of a wagon, or making the woods re-echo from his triumphant notes . . . The game-cocks which have come out of repeated conflicts victorious are honored with such names as ‘Bill Sherman,’ ‘Johnny Logan,’ etc.; while the defeated and bepecked victim is saluted with derisive appellations, such as ‘Jeff Davis,’ ‘Beauregard,’ or ‘Bob Lee’” (46).
