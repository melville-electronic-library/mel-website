    So helped you that in fame you dwell;
You bore the first iron battle&apos;s burden
    Sealed as in a <ref target="#ref_19286">diving-bell</ref><note xml:id="ref_19286">"In a poem published many years later, 'In a Church in Padua,' Melville describes the Roman Catholic confessional booth: "Dread diving-bell! In thee inurned/ What hollows the priest must sound,/ Descending into consciences/ Where more is hid than found." (William B. Shurr, The Mystery of Iniquity, p. 35) [intertextual; critical]</note>.

To bring forth <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:186" type="person">King Admetus&apos;</name> bride,
Braved naught more vaguely direful and untried.
    What poet shall uplift his charm,
Bold Sailor, to your height of daring,
    And interblend therewith the calm,
And build a goodly style upon your bearing.
                                                                                     
Escaped the gale of outer ocean—
    <ref target="#ref_19285">Cribbed</ref><note xml:id="ref_19285">"One must look to the major landmark of the history of this word in Macbeth. Macbeth has just experienced his first reversal: 'Most royal sir, Fleance is 'scaped.' Stunned by the implications, Macbeth replies "Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect,/ Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,/ As broad and general as the casing air:/ But now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confined, bound in/ To saucy doubts and fears." (III, iv; William B. Shurr, Mystery of Iniquity, p. 36) [Allusion, literary; critical] </note> in a craft which like a log
Was washed by every billow&apos;s motion—
By night you heard of <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:187" type="person">Og

You marked the sunk ship&apos;s flag-staff slim,
    Lit by her burning sister&apos;s heart;
You marked, and mused: “Day brings the trial:
    Then be it proved if I have part
With men whose manhood never took denial.”
                                                                                      
A prayer went up—a champion&apos;s. Morning
    Beheld you in the Turret walled
By adamant, where a <ref target="#ref_19287">spirit</ref><note xml:id="ref_19287">"The tutoring spirit, a monitor in another sense, must inspire ambiguous courage: it not only forewarns but *derides*." (Shurr, The Mystery of Iniquity, p. 36) [critical]</note> forewarning
    And <ref target="#ref_19288">all-deriding</ref><note xml:id="ref_19288">"Derision, the cosmic laugh, is a spirit and therefore real and pervasive." (Schurr, The Mystery of Iniquity, p. 36) [critical]
See "*Derision* stirs the deep abyss" in "The Conflict of Convictions." [intertextual]</note> called:
“Man, darest thou—desperate, unappalled—
Be first to lock thee in the armored tower?
I have thee now; and what the battle-hour
    To me shall bring—heed well—thou&apos;lt share;
This plot-work, planned to be the foeman&apos;s tenor,
    To thee may prove a <ref target="#ref_19289">goblin-snare</ref><note xml:id="ref_19289">"What Worden fins himself alone with is nothing less than the cosmic spirit of evil pervading and controlling the universe." (Schurr, The Mystery of Iniquity, p. 37) [critical] </note>;
Its very strength and cunning—monstrous error!”
                                                                                     
“Stand up, my heart; be strong; what matter
    If here thou seest thy welded tomb?
And let huge Og with thunders batter—
    Duty be still my doom,
Though drowning come in liquid gloom;

Ay, Turret, rivet me here to duty fast!”—
    So nerved, you fought, wisely and well;
And live, twice live in life and story;
    But over your Monitor dirges swell,
In wind and wave that keep the rites of glory.
