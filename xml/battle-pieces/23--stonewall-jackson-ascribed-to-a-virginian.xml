</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">One man we claim of wrought renown
    Which not the North shall care to slur;
A Modern lived who sleeps in death,
    Calm as the marble Ancients are:
            &apos;Tis he whose life, though a vapor&apos;s wreath
        Was charged with the lightning&apos;s burning breath—
                <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:137" type="person">Stonewall</name>, stormer of the war.
                                                                                       
But who shall hymn the Roman heart?
    A stoic, he, but even more:
The iron will and lion thew
    Were strong to inflict as to endure:
            Who like him could stand, or pursue?
            His fate the fatalist followed through;
            In all his great soul found to do
                 Stonewall followed his star.

    Through the sleet to the wintry war;
And he followed it on when he bowed the grain—
    The Wind of the Shenandoah;
           At <name ref="https://www.nps.gov/rich/learn/historyculture/gainesmillbull.htm" type="event"><name ref=" " type="text">Gaines&apos;s Mill</name></name> in the giants&apos; strain—
           On the fierce forced stride to <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:450" type="place">Manassas</name>-plain,
           Where his sword with thunder was clothed again,
                  Stonewall followed his star.
                                                                                                                                                                             
His star he followed athwart the flood
    To <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:451" type="place">Potomac</name>&apos;s Northern shore,
When midway wading, his host of braves
    <hi rend="italic">“ <ref target="#ref_19067">My Maryland!</ref><note xml:id="ref_19067">The State Song of Maryland
https://msa.maryland.gov/msa/mdmanual/01glance/html/symbols/lyricsco.html</note>”</hi> loud did roar—
           To red <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:457" type="place">Antietam</name>&apos;s field of graves,
           Through mountain-passes, woods and waves,
           They followed their pagod with hymns and <ref target="#ref_19083">glaives</ref><note xml:id="ref_19083">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Glaives_by_Wendelin_Boeheim.jpg#/media/File:Glaives_by_Wendelin_Boeheim.jpg</note>,
                    For Stonewall followed a star.
                                                                                       
Back it led him to <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:452" type="place">Marye</name>&apos;s slope,
    Where the shock and the fame he bore;
And to green <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:453" type="place">Moss-Neck </name>it guided him—
    Brief respite from throes of war:
           To the laurel glade by the <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:454" type="place">Wilderness</name> grim,
           Through climaxed victory naught shall dim,
           Even unto death it piloted him—
                    Stonewall followed his star.

    Which never the valiant mar;
A cap we sent him, bestarred, to replace
    The sun-scorched helm of war:
           A fillet he made of the shining lace
           Childhood&apos;s laughing brow to grace—
                  Not his was a goldsmith&apos;s star.
                                                                                       
O, much of doubt in after days
    Shall cling, as now, to the war;
Of the right and the wrong they&apos;ll still debate,
    Puzzled by Stonewall&apos;s star:
            “Fortune went with the North elate,”
            “Ay, but the South had Stonewall&apos;s weight,
                  And he fell in the South&apos;s vain war.”
