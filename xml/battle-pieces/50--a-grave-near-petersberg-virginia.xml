</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Head-board and foot-board duly placed—
  Grassed in the mound between;
Daniel Drouth is the slumberer&apos;s name—
  Long may his grave be green!

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Quick was his way—a flash and a blow,
  Full of his fire was he—
A fire of hell—&apos;tis burnt out now—
  Green may his grave long be!

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">May his grave be green, though he
  Was a rebel of iron mould;
Many a true heart—true to the Cause,
  Through the blaze of his wrath lies cold.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">May his grave be green—still green
  While happy years shall run;
May none come nigh to disinter
  The—<hi rend="italic">Buried Gun</hi>.</p></div></body>
