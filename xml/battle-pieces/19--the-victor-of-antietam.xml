Soon after, McClellan led the army in the Peninsula Campaign to take Richmond. After the bloody Seven Days' battles that ended the Peninsula Campaign without the capture of Richmond, Lincoln relieved McClellan of his command, appointing Henry Halleck as General-in-Chief of the army and General John Pope as commander of the Army of the Potomac (https://www.civilwar.org/learn/biographies/george-b-mcclellan).

<p>Whatever just military criticism, favorable or otherwise, has at any time been made upon General McClellan's campaigns, will stand. But if, during the excitement of the conflict, aught was spread abroad tending to unmerited disparagement of the man, it must necessarily die out, though not perhaps witout leaving some traces, which may or may not prove enduring. Some there are whose votes aided in the re-election of Abraham Lincoln, who yet believed, and retain the belief, that General McClellan, to say the least, always proved himself a patriotic and honorable soldier. The feeling which surviving comrades entertain for their late commander is one which, from its passion, is susceptible of versified representation, and such it receives.</p>

<p>At Antietam Stonewall Jackson led one wing of Lee's army, consequently sharing that day in whatever may be deemed to have been the fortunes of his superior.

<!-- COMBINE THE McClellan NOTES AND THIS ONE INTO A AN OPENING note: <note xml:id="ref_21115"> In her article “Correspondent Lines,” Eliza Richards interprets the “univocality” of both spectators (those “long the line” of newspaper reports) and soldiers (who later shout “Antietam’s cheers” along the line of battle) as “eerily mindless.” Richards adds that the “authority" that promotes McClellan is "probably not the will of the people [...] since ‘Antietam’s cheers’ preceded or accompanied a slaughter—not to mention that McClellan lost his command soon after the battle …” (156).
