<!-- <note xml:id="ref_21115"> In her article “Correspondent Lines,” Eliza Richards interprets the “univocality” of both spectators (those “long the line” of newspaper reports) and soldiers (who later shout “Antietam’s cheers” along the line of battle) as “eerily mindless.” Richards adds that the “authority" that promotes McClellan is "probably not the will of the people [...] since ‘Antietam’s cheers’ preceded or accompanied a slaughter—not to mention that McClellan lost his command soon after the battle …” (156).

<l>And loom of jeopardy—dismissed.<note xml:id="ref_21072">Due to Lincoln’s eagerness to mount an offensive against Lee’s army and McClellan’s hesitancy, the latter was removed as General-in-Chief in the spring of 1862, though he still retained command of the Potomac Army. Soon after, McClellan led the army in the Peninsula Campaign to take Richmond. After the bloody Seven Day’s battles that ended the Peninsula Campaign without the capture of Richmond, Lincoln relieved McClellan of his command, appointing Henry Halleck as General-in-Chief of the army and General John Pope as commander of the Army of the Potomac (https://www.civilwar.org/learn/biographies/george-b-mcclellan).

<l>The <ref target="#ref_21067">leadsmen</ref><note xml:id="ref_21067">In lines 45-46, Hennig Cohen suggests that Melville offers several nautically-themed puns. As one of them, “leadsman” is someone who “takes soundings or measurements of depth with a lead-weighted line.” However, Cohen contends that the primary meaning for this line is of “a person who leads.” Cohen adds that this signification “is re-enforced by the fact that (leadsman) is a variant of (lodesman), meaning leader, guide, pilot or steersman (N.E.D.) (234).</note> quarrelled <ref target="#ref_21068">in the bay</ref><note xml:id="ref_21068">Hennig Cohen identifies this phrase as one of three nautical puns in lines 45-46.

Lee sent several divisions, including Major General Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson to attack the Union’s Glendale position, which was located between Malvern Hill and White Oak Swamp. Federal artillery prevented Jackson’s advance through White Oak Swamp (“The Seven Days Battles,” https://www.civilwar.org/learn/articles/seven-days-battles).</note>,</l>

In the last stanza, McClellan’s support has dwindled as many of the soldiers who loved him have died in battle. Richards reads “deep files” as an image that “evokes both trenches dug as mass graves and swathes of men cut down by mechanized weapons in rows running perpendicular to advancing battle lines” (“Correspondent Lines” 157).</note></l>

<l rend="8em"><ref target="#ref_21117">McClellan</ref><note xml:id="ref_21117">Eliza Richards argues that the poem’s broken lines, cut short to shout “McClellan” in a “one-beat line,” create a visual impression of newspaper and poetry print “full of white spaces and gaps that cannot be closed.” Richards reads this discontinuity in the poem’s lineation as “an analogy to looking around the table and seeing the permanent gaps in a once seemingly solid and infinite black line of force” (“Correspondent Lines” 158).
