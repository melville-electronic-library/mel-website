<note>Note 4: [Criticism] Caddell notes that “this poem challenges the Wordsworthian model of the epitaph both in its plurality of dead speakers, who address a reader apt to ‘misgive’ their reasons for fighting and dying, and in the less-than-noble motivations that brought them to their end – they died ‘amiss’” (308). (Christina Lee)
