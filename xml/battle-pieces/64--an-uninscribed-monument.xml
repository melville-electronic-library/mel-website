<note [Critical] In a close analysis of the poem’s rhyme scheme, Sweet (2015) demonstrates the poem’s turn from ballad form to sonnet form and argues that the “critical citizenship” is performed in this poem “through a departure from the vernacular forms that traditionally produce the emotional satisfactions of citizenship” (37, 39). (Christina Lee)</note></ref><note xml:id="ref_21288">NOTE: [Critical] Caddell suggests that the modified sonnet form and the thematic tensions between silence and speaking “betray a genre at its breaking point but also signal a possible way out of the crisis” (310). Finseth argues that the formal and thematic characteristics of this poem points towards “the process of building ‘nascent’ moral perspectives” (85). (Christina Lee)
