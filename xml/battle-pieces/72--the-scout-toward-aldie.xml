Hennig Cohen notes that "separation pages set it off from the memorial verses which precede and from 'Lee in the Capitol' which follows.  In addition to its length it is unusual in its origin and its form.  Melville was not rehashing The Rebellion Record (italics) but was creating from personal experience and from events described to him by soldiers he had met, and he had chosen a genre, the literary ballad, which he had not previously attempted" (287). [biography]  "Aldie is situated in Loudon County, about ten miles south of Leesburg [Virginia], the county seat.  Loudon Valley lies between the Bull Run Mountains on the east and the Blue Ridge on the west" (Cohen, 287).  Aldie is located west of Vienna, Virginia, to which location Melville traveled with his brother Allan to see their cousin, Lieutenant Colonel Henry Gansevoort, commander of the 13th New York Cavalry, in April 1864.  The "scout" in which Melville participated that month moved west from Vienna towards Aldie--a region essentially controlled by the elusive and feared Colonel John S. Mosby and his troops (and aptly nicknamed "Mosby's Confederacy").  [biography] [place] [event] (Karah Mitchell)</note>

<note xml:id="ref_21113">Stanton Garner notes that the real-life scout toward Aldie was composed of a rather large number of men: "[General] Tyler [sent] out a large scout of five hundred cavalry and infantry led by two brigade commanders" (1982 Melville Society piece, 14).  The group of infantry, Garner notes, was led by Colonel Arthur H. Grimshaw while Colonel Charles Russell Lowell was in charge of the group of cavalry.  [biography] [event] (Karah Mitchell)</note>

<l rend="4em">But <ref target="#ref_21087">Mosby&apos;s men</ref> are there—</l><note xml:id="ref_21087">Colonel John S. Mosby, commander of the 43rd Battalion of Virginia Cavalry, otherwise known as the "Partisan Raiders," the "Partisan Rangers," "Mosby's Rangers," or simply, as denoted here in the poem, "Mosby's Men."  Formed in January 1863, Mosby's group of soldiers became known for their ability to elude Union forces and their constant, unsettling presence in northeastern Virginia.  Mosby's group of men did not formally demobilize until after the war, on April 21, 1865 (NN Published Poems, 668-669; Hennig Cohen, pp. 286-287). "Mosby's Partisan Rangers, . . . and their guerrilla tactics of surprise hit and strategic run kept a disproportionately large force of Federal troops pinned down to the defense of Washington between January 1863 and April 1865."  (NN Published Poems, 669.)  [biography] [name] (Karah Mitchell)</note>
  <l rend="4em">Of Mosby best <ref target="#ref_21118">beware.</ref><note xml:id="ref_21118">Both Jonathan Cook and Joseph Fargnoli observe that the poem's formal qualities are resonant of both the ballad form and rhyme royal.  Cook notes that the poem "follows ballad tradition in some basic aspects of its theme and form, except for its seven-line stanza, technically a heptastich or septet, in iambic tetrameter with a rhyme scheme of a-b-c-d-b-c-c.  The most familiar septet stanza is 'rhyme royal,' which uses iambic pentameter in a rhyme scheme of a-b-a-b-b-c-c.  Rhyme royal had been pioneered by Chaucer in The Parlement of Foules (italics), Troilus and Criseyde (italics), and four Canterbury Tales (italics), and subsequently utilized by a number of poets including Spenser in his Four Hymns (italics) and Shakespeare in The Rape of Lucrece (italics).  Melville's octosyllabic line and restricted rhyme scheme were probably intended to tone down some of the verbal music of rhyme royal while substituting frequent alliteration for reduced end rhyme" (73-74).  Fargnoli offers a similar but slightly different observation on the poem's formal qualities: "The 798-line poem, of 114 septets in a consistent, abcdbcc (italics) rhyme scheme and a prevailingly iambic, octosyllabic line, harks back to similar and related ballads and to such English lyrics and verse romances as Surrey's 'The Seafarer,' Wyatt's 'Resignation' and 'The Lute Obeys,' and Charles Sackville, the Earl of Dorset's 'Song: Written at Sea, in the First Dutch War, 1665, the Night before an Engagement.'  Related forms of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century verse romances, especially complaints, evoked by Melville's poem are those set in the dominant septet style of the rhyme royal, such as Shakespeare's 'The Rape of Lucrece' and Michael Drayton's 'Fame and Fortune.'  Typical of these verse genres, and what 'Scout' shares with them that suggests its descendancy from the archetype or the quest myth, is the story of the tragic downfall of an ambitious or noble character" (335).

<l rend="4em">A <ref target="#ref_21097">spell</ref><note xml:id="ref_21097">"Like many another writer of the Romantic period, Melville sought to inform his poem with the authority of folk expression.  His setting is a land of enchantment, an 'Eerie land' (line 29).  His characters and situations fit the ballad pattern.  He introduces shape-shifters (lines 18, 700) and haunted houses (line 198); much talk of spells, charms, elves, fairies, and ghosts; and an invisible personage who ravages the countryside, invulnerable to lead bullets but perhaps not to silver ones (line 728)"  (Cohen, 287-288). Several other scholars have noted the fantasy-like qualities of the poem and the significance of these qualities when examining the larger poetic traditions that informed Melville's writing.  See Jonathan Cook, "History, Legend, and Poetic Tradition in Melville's 'The Scout Toward Aldie,'" Joseph Fargnoli's "Archetype and History in Melville's 'The Scout Toward Aldie,'" and Megan Williams' "'Sounding the Wilderness': Representations of the Heroic in Herman Melville's Battle-Pieces and Aspects of the War (italics)."

<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The morning-bugles lonely play,
  Lonely the evening-bugle calls—
Unanswered voices in the wild;
The settled hush of birds in nest
  Becharms, and all the wood enthralls:
    Memory&apos;s self is so beguiled
    That Mosby seems a <ref target="#ref_21119">satyr</ref><note xml:id="ref_21119">Definition from the OED: "One of a class of woodland gods or demons, in form partly human and partly bestial, supposed to be the companions of Bacchus" (definition 1.a.).  [definition]  For Jonathan Cook, this characterization of Mosby as "a satyr's child" displays yet another way in which Melville's poem utilizes "Spenserian prototypes" (75).  "If popular balladry probably helped Melville conceptualize certain aspects of his narrative poem, Spenser's poetry, an abiding influence on his writing (Moses), aided him as well.  Melville was re-reading his multi-volume edition of Spenser in August 1864, a few months after his return to New York from Washington and Northern Virginia, at which time he may have already begun the narrative poem based on his scouting expedition (Parker 578-579).  Thus it comes as no surprise that The Faerie Queene (italics) apparently contributed to several aspects of setting, theme, and characterization in 'The Scout Toward Aldie.' . . . Mosby is described as a 'satyr's child' because of his close identification with the sylvan setting of the poem . . . .  The 'satyr's child' of Books I, III, and IV of The Faerie Queene (italics) is, of course, Sir Satyrane, the offspring of a satyr and a court lady.  Raised in the woods by his wild father and then polished in the world of his civilized mother, this 'natural' knight becomes a votary and defender of Una after her attempted rape by Sans Loy in Book I, Canto VI.  The implied association in Melville's poem of Mosby with the world of Greek pastoral and Spenser's Sir Satyrane complicates the guerrilla leader's moral identity, but it is ultimately only a trick of the landscape that allows for this transformation" (74-75).

The <ref target="#ref_21102">Capitol dome</ref><note xml:id="ref_21102">"The new iron dome of the Capitol building in Washington, D.C., could be seen from 'Mosby's Confederacy' in nearby northern Virginia" (NN Published Poems, 670).  "Aldie is some 30 miles from Washington" (Cohen, 288). Grant Shreve offers an insightful observation about the significance of this physical marker, especially with reference to the Spenserian qualities of the poem: "The figurative shadow cast by the Dome introduces a looming presence upon the scene and disrupts the dreamscape of this American fairyland.  The mythical quality of the Virginian woods is shattered by the 'vision' that the Dome imposes upon the observers below.  In one sense this vision is a literal sight that perverts the physical beauty of the Arcadian scene, but it is also a glance into the future, a vision in the prophetic sense of the physical dominance of the North over the South and of the shadow, beneath which Virginia will hereafter operate" ("Shadows of Reconstruction," 15-16).  [place] [critical] (Karah Mitchell)  </note>—hazy—sublime—
  A vision breaking on a <ref target="#ref_21120">dream</ref><note xml:id="ref_21120">Noah Webster's 1846 edition of An American Dictionary of the English Language (italics)--which Melville owned--defines "vision" as follows: "1. The act of seeing external objects; actual sight. 2. The faculty of seeing; sight. 3. Something imagined to be seen, though not real; a phantom: a spectre.  --4. In Scripture (italicize), a revelation from God. 5. Something imaginary; the production of fancy. 6. Any thing which is the object of sight" (908).  For its noun form, "dream" has the following definition: "1. The thought or series of thoughts of a person in sleep. --2. In Scripture (italics), dreams (italics) were sometimes impressions on the mind of sleeping persons, made by divine agency. 3. A vain fancy; a wild conceit; an unfounded suspicion" (275).  Melville's phrasing implies a difference between the two nouns, but Webster's definitions do not fully separate the two. [definition] (Karah Mitchell)   </note>:

  We soldiers do what we deplore—
I must detain you till we march&quot;
The stranger nodded. Nettled now,
  He grew politer than before:—

    The lady stiffened in her starch.

  Ask what may seem a little rude.
Pardon—that veil—withdraw it, please
(Corporal! make every man fall back);

    That Mosby haunts the villages.&quot;

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Slowly the stranger drew her veil,
  And looked the Soldier in the eye—
A glance of mingled foul and fair;
Sad patience in a proud disdain,
  And more than quietude. A sigh
    She heaved, and if all unaware,
    And far seemed Mosby from her care.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">While echoes ran, a wagon old,
  Under stout guard of Corporal Chew
Came up; a lame horse, dingy white,
With clouted harness; ropes in hand,
  Cringed the humped driver, black in hue;
    By him (for Mosby&apos;s band a sight)
    A sister-rebel sat, her veil held tight.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">&quot;I picked them up,&quot; the Corporal said,
  &quot;Crunching their way over stick and root,
Through yonder wood. The man here—Cuff—
Says they are going to Leesburg town&quot;

  Holding the Surgeon&apos;s flask with a smile
To a young scapegrace from the glen.
&quot;O yes!&quot; he eagerly replied,
  &quot;And thank you, Colonel, but—any guile?
    For if you think we&apos;ll blab—why, then
    You don&apos;t know Mosby or his men.&quot;

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The Leader&apos;s genial air relaxed.
  &quot;Best give it up,&quot; a whisperer said.
&quot;By heaven, I&apos;ll range their rebel den&quot;
&quot;They&apos;ll treat you well,&quot; the captive cried;
  &quot;They&apos;re all like us—handsome—well bred:
    In wood or town, with sword or pen,
    Polite is Mosby, bland his men.&quot;

  &quot;Bad plan to make a scout too long;
The tide may turn, and drag them back,
And more beside. These rides I&apos;ve been,
  And every time a mine was sprung.
    To rescue, mind, they won&apos;t be slack—
    Look out for Mosby&apos;s rifle-crack.&quot;

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">&quot;We&apos;ll welcome it! give crack for crack!
  Peril, old lad, is what I seek&quot;
&quot;O then, there&apos;s plenty to be had—
By all means on, and have our fill&quot;
  With that, grotesque, he writhed his neck,
    Showing a scar by buck-shot made—
    Kind Mosby&apos;s Christmas gift, he said.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">&quot;But, Colonel, my prisoners—let a guard
  Make sure of them, and lead to camp.
That done, we&apos;re free for a dark-room fight
If so you say.&quot; The other laughed;
  &quot;Trust me, Major, nor throw a damp.
    But first to try a little sleight—
    Sure news of Mosby would suit me quite.&quot;

  Jested; and yet they anxious showed;
Virginians; some of family-pride,
And young, and full of fire, and fine

    But list! one speaks for Mosby&apos;s side.

  The guard, remiss, had given a chance
For a sudden sally into the cover—
But foiled the intent, nor fired a shot,
  Though the issue was a deadly trance;
    For, hurled &apos;gainst an oak that humped low over,
    Mosby&apos;s man fell, pale as a lover.

  Back came the Blues, with a troop of Grays,
Ten riding double—luckless ten!—
Five horses gone, and looped hats lost,

    Of Mosby—not his veteran men.

  Was glad &apos;twas not for him to say
What next should be; if a trooper bleeds,

    And Mosby many a problem breeds.

The current Merriam-Webster (italicize) dictionary notes, "The Greek god Hermes, who served as herald and messenger to the other gods, carried a winged staff entwined with two snakes. The staff of Aesculapius, the god of healing, had one snake and no wings. The word 'caduceus,' from Latin, is a modification of Greek karykeion, from karyx, meaning 'herald.' Strictly speaking, 'caduceus' should refer only to the staff of the herald-god Hermes (Mercury to the Romans), but in practice the word is often applied to the one-snake staff as well. You might logically expect the staff of Aesculapius to be the symbol of the medical profession-and indeed, that is the symbol used by the American Medical Association. But you will also quite frequently see the true caduceus used as a medical symbol." [definition] (Karah Mitchell)</note>, black and green.

Shaw of Staten Island, had had literary dealings with Herman in connection with the firm of Putnam's, and her brother-in-law, George Washington Curtis, had been one of his editors at Putnam's" (Garner, 11).  Josephine was also the sister of Robert Gould Shaw, commander of the Massachusetts 54th, the first regiment composed of African-Americans during the Civil War, and who was killed along with a number of his men at the Second Battle of Fort Wagner in July 1863.  Garner notes that Josephine would have been in camp and actually greeted the Melvilles during their visit, while several other scholars simply note that Melville would have heard that she had visited the camp before. "The Lowells were a dazzling couple.  Charles was a handsome, brilliant, and fearless officer who, it has been said, might one day have been president of the United States had the War not cut him down.  Effy, barely out of her teens and at this time a month pregnant, was equally impressive: intelligent, witty, educated, athletic, and strong, she still managed to conform to nineteenth-century standards of feminine beauty and grace.  William James, seeing the two together on horseback, thought that 'they looked so young and victorious'" (Garner, 11-12).  [person] (Karah Mitchell)</note> is in the camp—

This becomes evident in a literal sense when one reads through the poem; however, one can also read this foreshadowing as a symbolic one.  In his notes to the poem, Robert Penn Warren includes Edmund Wilson's observations about the poem as a romance between not simply Colonel Lowell and his bride, but also the North and the South: "[Throughout the poem's story] we are made to feel that the colonel has a kind of fatal rendezvous with the sinister ranger [Mosby], that he is drawn to his opponent by a kind of spell that is somehow a good deal more powerful than the attraction which had drawn him to his bride.  . . . [T]he story, though so personal a product of Melville's imagination, has also its historical significance in its insight into one aspect of the Civil War.  What Melville has revealed in the fanciful tale inspired by his visit to his cousin is a mutual fascination of each of the two camps with the other, the intimate essence of a conflict which, though fratricidal, was also incestuous . . . . .  This peculiar entanglement with one another of the American North and South was, after the war, to give rise to a formula of romantic fiction which continued to be popular for decades and which produced all those novels and plays in which two lovers, one Northern, one Southern, though destined for one another, are divided by their loyalties to their different flags" (Warren, 381).

Ah, <ref target="#ref_21133">love in a tent is a queenly thing</ref><note xml:id="ref_21133">Stanton Garner and Herschel Parker offer differing accounts about the Lowells' lodgings while in camp. Parker notes, "Lowell had his headquarters in a farmhouse, although he and his wife slept in a tent" (567).  Garner, on the other hand, claims that the Lowells "shared a small house" (11) and that this line is thus the result of "poetic license" (307).  According to Grant Shreve, this line "recalls the biblical tale of Jael and Sisera from the Book of Judges, wherein the fleeing foe of the Israelites, Sisera, enters the tent of Jael, who promises him protection, only to later drive a tent stake into his head once he has fallen asleep.  Stanton Garner notes that Colonel Lowell--whom Melville had followed while sojourning in the field--had stayed with his wife not in a tent but in a cottage.  Garner attributes this change to 'poetic license' (Garner 307), but the echoes of the tale of Jael and Sisera render Melville's transformation of the Colonel's residence more deliberate and weighty.  The allusiveness of the stanza not only ironizes the Colonel's final tryst but also establishes a figural shadow beneath the text that anticipates both the Colonel's death and Melville's prophetic vision of the fate of the Union" (17).

Milton reinterprets the story of Jael through Dalila's final speech, which Melville had heavily marked in his copy of Milton's poetic works. . . .  Melville's lines echo Dalila's valorization of the fame and honor she believes her betrayal will win her.  The 'fame' that 'refines the [marriage] vow' . . . points toward both the Colonel's fame and the kind of fame Dalila exalts.  In Milton, it 'refines the vow' by purification, and in Melville, it refines by a clarification that reveals a corruption in the vow itself" (17).  [critical] [allusion] (Karah Mitchell)</note>.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The weary troop that wended now—
  Hardly it seemed the same that pricked
Forth to the forest from the camp:
Foot-sore horses, jaded men;
  Every backbone felt as nicked,
    Each eye dim as a sick-room lamp,
    All faces stamped with Mosby&apos;s stamp.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1438003292694-5m2dq5dl4yzj8aor-181b93fa5885873b6ec1b715ced0abee%2F231.jpg"/>As they searched for the fallen, the dawn grew chill;
  They lay in the dew: &quot;Ah! hurt much, Mink?
And—yes—the Colonel!&quot; Dead! but so calm
That death seemed nothing—even death,
  The thing we deem every thing heart can think;
    Amid wilding roses that shed their balm,
    Careless of Mosby he lay—in a charm!

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The Major took him by the Hand—
  Into the friendly clasp it bled
(A ball through heart and hand he rued):
&quot;Good-by&quot; and gazed with humid glance;
  Then in a hollow revery said
    &quot;The weakness thing is lustihood;
    But Mosby—&quot; and he checked his mood.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">&quot;Where&apos;s the advance?—cut off, by heaven!
  Come, Surgeon, how with your wounded there&quot;
&quot;The ambulance will carry all&quot;
&quot;Well, get them in; we go to camp.
  Seven prisoners gone? for the rest have care&quot;
    Then to himself, &quot;This grief is gall;
    That Mosby!—I&apos;ll cast a silver ball!&quot;

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1438003289602-ticnd2tnil7vte29-181b93fa5885873b6ec1b715ced0abee%2F230.jpg"/>&quot;Major,&quot; burst in a bugler small,
  &quot;The fellow we left in Loudon grass—
Sir slyboots with the inward bruise,
His voice I heard—the very same—
  Some watchword in the ambush pass;
    Ay, sir, we had him in his shoes—
    We caught him—Mosby—but to lose!&quot;

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">&quot;Go, go!—these saddle-dreamers! Well,
  And here&apos;s another.—Cool, sir, cool&quot;
&quot;Major, I saw them mount and sweep,
And one was humped, or I mistake,
  And in the skurry dropped his wool&quot;
    &quot;A wig! go fetch it:—the lads need sleep;
    They&apos;ll next see Mosby in a sheep!

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">&quot;Come, come, fall back! reform yours ranks—
  All&apos;s jackstraws here! Where&apos;s Captain Morn?—
We&apos;ve parted like boats in a raging tide!
But stay-the Colonel—did he charge?
  And comes he there? &apos;Tis streak of dawn;
    Mosby is off, the woods are wide—
    Hist! there&apos;s a groan—this crazy ride!&quot;

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1438003286169-l24kpbe003wyiudi-181b93fa5885873b6ec1b715ced0abee%2F229.jpg"/>As restive they turn, how sore they feel,
  And cross, and sleepy, and full of spleen,
And curse the war. &quot;Fools, North and South&quot;
Said one right out. &quot;O for a bed!
  O now to drop in this woodland green&quot;
    He drops as the syllables leave his mouth—
    Mosby speaks from the undergrowth—

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Speaks in a volley! out jets the flame!
  Men fall from their saddles like plums from trees;
Horses take fright, reins tangle and bind;
&quot;Steady—Dismount—form—and into the wood&quot;
  They go, but find what scarce can please:
    Their steeds have been tied in the field behind,
    And Mosby&apos;s men are off like the wind.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Sound the recall! vain to pursue—
  The enemy scatters in wilds he knows,
To reunite in his own good time;
And, to follow, they need divide—
  To come lone and lost on crouching foes:
    Maple and hemlock, beech and lime,
    Are Mosby&apos;s confederates, share the crime.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1438003283062-mz5ahu5hup7gb9-181b93fa5885873b6ec1b715ced0abee%2F228.jpg"/>&quot;But what comes here?&quot; A man from the front
  Reported a tree athwart the road.
&quot;Go round it, then; no time to bide;
All right—go on! Were one to stay
  For each distrust of a nervous mood,
    Long miles we&apos;d make in this our ride
    Through Mosby-land.—Oh! with the Guide!&quot;

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Then sportful to the Surgeon turned:
  &quot;Green sashes hardly serve by night&quot;
&quot;Nor bullets nor bottles,&quot; the Major sighed,
&quot;Against these moccasin-snakes—such foes
  As seldom come to solid fight:
    They kill and vanish; through grass they glide;
    Devil take Mosby!—&quot; his horse here shied.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">&quot;Hold! look—the tree, like a dragged balloon;
  A globe of leaves—some trickery here;
My nag is right—best now be shy&quot;
A movement was made, a hubbub and snarl;
  Little was plain—they blindly steer.
    The Pleiads, as from ambush sly,
    Peep out—Mosby&apos;s men in the sky!

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1438003279935-x14f79qwsxq7iudi-181b93fa5885873b6ec1b715ced0abee%2F227.jpg"/>&quot;Tut, Major! by what craft or guile—&quot;
  &quot;Can&apos;t tell! but he&apos;ll be found in wait.
Softly we enter, say, the town—
Good! pickets post, and all so sure—
  When—crack! the rifles from every gate,
    The Gray-backs fire—dashes up and down—
    Each alley unto Mosby known!&quot;

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">&quot;Now, Major, now—you take dark views
  Of a moonlight night.&quot; &quot;Well, well, we&apos;ll see&quot;
And smoked as if each whiff were gain.
The other mused; then sudden asked,
  &quot;What would you do in grand decree&quot;
    I&apos;d beat, if I could, Lee&apos;s armies—then
    Send constables after Mosby&apos;s men.&quot;

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">&quot;Ay! ay!—you&apos;re odd.&quot; The moon sailed up;
  On through the shadowy land they went.
&quot;Names must be made and printed be!&quot;
Hummed the blithe Colonel. &quot;Doc, your flask!
  Major, I drink to your good content.
    My pipe is out—enough for me!
    One&apos;s buttons shine—does Mosby see?

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1438003275863-k8yqwicciukmaemi-181b93fa5885873b6ec1b715ced0abee%2F226.jpg"/>
&quot;No doubt, no doubt:—was that a hare?—
  First catch, then cook; and cook him brown&quot;
&quot;Trust me to catch,&quot; the other cried—
&quot;The lady&apos;s letter!—a dance, man, dance
  This night is given in Leesburg town&quot;
    &quot;He&apos;ll be there too!&quot; wheezed out the Guide;
    &quot;That Mosby loves a dance and ride!&quot;

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">&quot;The lady, ah!—the lady&apos;s letter—
  A lady, then, is in the case&quot;
Muttered the Major. &quot;Ay, her aunt
Writes her to come by Friday eve
  (To-night), for people of the place,
    At Mosby&apos;s last fight jubilant,
    A party give, though table-cheer be scant.&quot;

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The Major hemmed. &quot;Then this night-ride
  We owe to her?—One lighted house
In a town else dark.—The moths, begar!
Are not quite yet all dead!&quot; &quot;How? how&quot;
  &quot;A mute, meek mournful little mouse!—
    Mosby has wiles which subtle are—
    But woman&apos;s wiles in wiles of war!&quot;

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1438003272017-qt6lejm3oj2it3xr-181b93fa5885873b6ec1b715ced0abee%2F225.jpg"/>But cordial words no balm could bring;
  She sighed, and kept her inward chafe,
And seemed to hate the voice of glee—
Joyless and tearless. Soon he called
  An escort: &quot;See this lady safe
    In yonder house.—Madam, you&apos;re free.
    And now for Mosby.—Guide! with me.&quot;

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(&quot;A night-ride, eh?&quot;) &quot;Tighten your girths!
  But, buglers! not a note from you.
Fling more rails on the fires—a blaze&quot;
(&quot;Sergeant, a feint—I told you so—
  Toward Aldie again. Bivouac, adieu!&quot;)
    After the cheery flames they gaze,
    Then back for Mosby through the maze.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The moon looked through the trees, and tipped
  The scabbards with her elfin beam;
The Leader backward cast his glance,
Proud of the cavalcade that came—
  A hundred horses, bay and cream:
    &quot;Major! look how the lads advance—
    Mosby we&apos;ll have in the ambulance!&quot;
<pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1438003268729-zvpnlw2b4vx6r-181b93fa5885873b6ec1b715ced0abee%2F224.jpg"/>That captain was a valorous one
  (No irony, but honest truth),
Yet down from his brain cold drops distilled,
Making stalactites in his heart—
  A conscientious soul, forsooth;
    And with a formal hate was filled
    Of Mosby&apos;s band; and some he&apos;d killed.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Meantime the lady rueful sat,
  Watching the flicker of a fire
Were the Colonel played the outdoor host
In brave old hall of ancient Night.
  But ever the dame grew shyer and shyer,
    Seeming with private grief engrossed—
    Grief far from Mosby, housed or lost.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The ruddy embers showed her pale.
  The Soldier did his best devoir:
&quot;Some coffee?—no?—cracker?—one&quot;
Cared for her servant—sought to cheer:
  &quot;I know, I know—a cruel war!
    But wait—even Mosby&apos;ll eat his bun;
    The Old Hearth—back to it anon!&quot;

        Slyly in Tennessee—
      Not for chestnuts—better than that—
        Hugh, you bumble-bee!
          Nutting, nutting—
          All through the year there&apos;s nutting!
      A tree they spied so yellow,
        Rustling in motion queer;
      In they fired, and down they dropped—
        Butternuts, my dear!
          Nutting, nutting—
          Who&apos;ll &apos;list to go a-nutting?

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Ah! why should good fellows foemen be?
  And who would dream that foes they were—
Larking and singing so friendly then—
A family likeness in every face.
  But Captain Cloud made sour demur:
    &quot;Guard! keep your prisoners in the pen,
    And let none talk with Mosby&apos;s men.&quot;

          Wild violets cool!
      South of woods a small close grass—
          A vernal wool!
      Leaves are a&apos;bud on the sassafras—
          They&apos;ll soon be full;
      Blessings on the friendly screen—
      I&apos;m for the South! says the leafage green.
      Robins! fly, and take your fill
          Of out-of-doors—
      Garden, orchard, meadow, hill,
          Barns and bowers;
      Take your fill, and have your will—
          Virginia&apos;s yours!
      But, bluebirds! keep away, and fear
      The ambuscade in bushes here.

  Ditty for ditty—prepare to cheer.

    You barehead Mosby-boys—why—clap!&quot;

  That lay along a hill-side green,
Bivouacked. Fires were made, and then
Coffee was boiled; a cow was coaxed
  And killed, and savory roasts were seen;
    And under the lee of a cattle-pen
    The guard supped freely with Mosby&apos;s men.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The ball was bandied to and fro;
  Hits were given and hits were met;
&quot;Chickamauga, Feds—take off your hat&quot;
&quot;But the Fight in the Clouds repaid you, Rebs&quot;
  &quot;Forgotten about Manassas yet&quot;
    Chatting and chaffing, and tit for tat,
    Mosby&apos;s clan with the troopers sat.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">&quot;Here comes the moon!&quot; a captive cried;
  &quot;A song! what say? Archy, my lad&quot;
Hailing are still one of the clan
(A boyish face with girlish hair),
  &quot;Give us that thing poor Pansy made
    Last Year.&quot; He brightened, and began;
    And this was the song of Mosby&apos;s man:

  &quot;Back into bondage? Man, you&apos;re free&quot;
&quot;Well, let we free!&quot; The Captain&apos;s brow
Lowered; the Colonel came—had heard:
  &quot;Pooh! pooh! his simple heart I see—
    A faithful servant.—Lady&quot; (a bow),
    &quot;Mosby&apos;s abroad—with us you&apos;ll go.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">&quot;Guard! look to your prisoners; back to camp!
  The man in the grass—can he mount and away?
Why, how he groans!&quot; &quot;Bad inward bruise—
Might lug him along in the ambulance&quot;
  &quot;Coals to Newcastle! let him stay.
    Boots and saddles!—our pains we lose,
    Nor care I if Mosby hear the news!&quot;

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">But word was sent to a house at hand,
  And a flask was left by the hurt one&apos;s side.
They seized in that same house a man,
Neutral by day, by night a foe—
  So charged his neighbor late, the Guide.
    A grudge? Hate will do what it can;
    Along he went for a Mosby-man.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">No secrets now; the bugle calls;
  The open road they take, nor shun
The hill; retrace the weary way.
But one there was who whispered low,
  &quot;This is a feint—we&apos;ll back anon;
    Young Hair-Brains don&apos;t retreat, they say;
    A brush with Mosby is the play!&quot;

  That with the Guide he went apart.
The Hospital Steward&apos;s turn began:
&quot;Must squeeze this darkey; every tap
  Of knowledge we are bound to start&quot;
    &quot;Garry,&quot; she said, &quot;tell all you can
    Of Colonel Mosby—that brave man.&quot;

  Know less dan me. But dis I know—&quot;
&quot;Well, what?&quot; &quot;I dun know what I know&quot;
&quot;A knowing answer!&quot; The hump-back coughed,
  Rubbing his yellowish wool like tow.
    &quot;Come—Mosby—tell!&quot; &quot;O dun look so!

  So ravaged by the war&apos;s wild play—
Campings, and foragings, and fires—
That now she sought an aunt&apos;s abode.
  Her Kinsmen? In Lee&apos;s army, they.
    The black? A servant, late her sire&apos;s.
    And Mosby? Vainly he inquires.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">He gazed, and sad she met his eye;
  &quot;In the wood yonder were you lost&quot;
No; at the forks they left the road
Because of hoof-prints (thick they were—
  Thick as the words in notes thrice crossed),
    And fearful, made that episode.
    In fear of Mosby? None she showed.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Her poor attire again he scanned:
  &quot;Lady, once more; I grieve to jar
On all sweet usage, but must plead
To have what peeps there from your dress;
  That letter—&apos;tis justly prize of war&quot;
    She started—gave it—she must need.
    &quot;&apos;Tis not from Mosby? May I read?&quot;</p></div>
