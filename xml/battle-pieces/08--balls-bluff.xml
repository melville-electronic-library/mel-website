<ref target="#ref_20693"></ref><note xml:id="ref_20693">In Lewis H. Steiner's diary, he relays his memory of General McClellan riding through Frederick, Maryland, in September, 1862. Steiner writes, "matrons held their babes towards him as their deliverer from the rule of a foreign army, and fair young ladies rushed to meet him on the streets, some even throwing their arms around his horse's neck" (24). Although women played roles in the Civil War that varied from caretaker to combatant, the vision of the woman cheering on the soldiers as they march to or from battle is pervasive. R. R. Hancock, Confederate soldier in the Second Tennessee Cavalry, recalls marching through La Grange, Tennessee, on Thursday, September 4, 1862. He writes, "the good ladies cheered us on our way with sweet music, both vocal and instrumental" (214).</note>
<ref target="#ref_20692">With fifes, and flags in mottoed pageantry;</ref><note xml:id="ref_20692"> Memories of the pageantry in the early days of the War can be found in many journals and biographies of Civil War soldiers. In John Williams's <hi rend="italic"> Leaves from a Trooper's Diary</hi>, published in 1869, the author remembers when the "air was alive with the roll of drums, and the flag-now dearer than ever before, flutter in miniature from every window" (8).</note>
<ref target="#ref_20690"></ref><note xml:id="ref_20690">We know that Melville had access to <hi rend="italic">Harper's Weekly</hi> (Sealts No. 241). He had apparently gifted volume 5 (1861) of <hi rend="italic">Harper's Weekly</hi> to Malcolm (Sealts No. 182). This volume features a picture that would have caught Melville's attention: <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/artwork:987">The Seventh Regiment Marching Down Broadway to Embark for the War</ref>. The image of the soldiers marching is often cited in Civil War memoirs. In John Wyeth's 1878 memoir, he recalls the meeting on August 7, 1862, in which he enlisted to fight for the New England Guard: "At the call for members to sign the new roll, there was a general rush, each being anxious to get his name on the list first; between two and three hundred men enlisted. On the same day the battalion paraded the city, with Flagg's band" (5).</note>
