				<note xml:id="EDnotePhotograph1">A likely source for the corps commander is General Winfield Scott Hancock. Wounded in the Union repulse of Pickett’s Charge at Gettysburg, he was told that as a commander he should not have risked his life, and replied: "There are times when a corps commander's life does not count." Hancock led a decisive charge during the Battle of Spotsylvania over a year later.</note>
