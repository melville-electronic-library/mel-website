<l>Did all the lets and bars appear</l>
<l>To every just or larger end,</l>
<l>Whence should come the trust and cheer?</l>
<l>Youth must its ignorant impulse lend—</l>
<l>Age finds place in the rear.</l>
<l>All wars are boyish, and are fought by boys,</l>
<l>The champions and enthusiasts of the state:</l>
<l>Turbid ardors and vain joys</l>
<l>Not barrenly abate—</l>
<l>Stimulants to the power mature,</l>
<l>Preparatives of <ref target="#ref_20558">fate</ref>
<note xml:id="ref_20558">In "The March into Virginia," Melville shows us the distinction between "fate" and "Fate." The lowercase use of the word indicates an unguided future. Whereas his use of "Fate" includes an element of the supernatural, whether it be the Greek Fates alluded to in <ref target="https://mel-juxta-editions.herokuapp.com/documents/244">"Apathy and Enthusiasm"</ref> or Lee's insistence that "the North and South were driven by Fate to arms" in <ref target="https://mel-juxta-editions.herokuapp.com/documents/353">"Lee in the Capitol."</ref></note>.</l>

<l>Who here forecasteth the event?</l>

Melville sees a "boyish" yearning within these young soldiers to learn about war through experience, despite the "warnings of the wise."</note>.

<l>No berrying party, pleasure-wooed,</l>
<l>No picnic party in the May,</l>
<l>Ever went less loth than they</l>
<l>Into that leafy neighborhood.</l>

Melville's use of Fate at the end of the verse is important. It tells us that there is the feeling of a supernatural force that is leading these young men toward their Fates. Melville gives us one horrific possibility for this supernatural source in the next verse: Moloch. </note>,

Melville may have, as Cohen mentions, been thinking about the roll call in <i> Paradise Lost </i>: "First Moloch, horrid King besmear'd with blood / Of human sacrifice, and parents' tears" (213). </note>;
	Expectancy, and glad surmise</l>
<l>Of battle&apos;s unknown mysteries.</l>
<l>All they feel is this: &apos;tis glory,</l>
<l>A rapture sharp, though transitory,</l>
<l>Yet lasting in belaureled story.</l>
<l>So they gayly go to fight,</l>
<l>Chatting left and laughing right.</l>

"Melville first underlined but did not line-through the printed last line--'The throe of Second Manassas share.'--and penciled a question mark in the right margin. Then he explicitly lined through the printed line and penciled, then lined through, 'Manassas' second throe and deadlier share'; then he penciled, below, 'Thy second shock, Manassas, share', and finally he substituted 'after' for 'second'.
