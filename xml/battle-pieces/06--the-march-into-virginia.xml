<l>Or <ref target="#BP_RNnote1">shame</ref><note xml:id="BP_RNnote1">REVISION NARRATIVE: In his personal copy of <hi rend="italic">Battle-Pieces</hi> (Copy A), Melville made two revisions to "shame." In pencil, he seems to have inscribed "a" in the left margin presumably to give "Or a shame survive," thereby particularizing the shame of defeat, applying it to the feelings of those fresh recruits who died at the first battle of Manassas and not referring to a generalized shame for the entire army or nation. Then, without deleting "a," Melville underlined "shame" and inscribed directly under "a" the word "some," implying a revision that gives instead "Or some survive." Here, "some" reiterates "some" in the stanza's first line, which refers to those who die. On the one hand, since the revision to "some" refers to survivors who go on to meet a worse defeat in the second battle of Manassas, the word "shame" might have been a previously undetected typo that Melville is correcting to the originally intended "some." In this scenario, the revision restores an otherwise bungled parallelism in the stanza between some who die and some who survive. On the other hand, Melville may have discovered the potential for a previously unimagined parallelism, in the process of revision as he tinkered with "shame."

In the bound sheets copy of <hi rend="italic">Battle-Pieces</hi> (Copy C), Melville made several revisions to the last line of "The March into Virginia," oscillating between options. The editors of the NN <hi rend="italic">Published Poems</hi> offer a revision sequence that begins with Melville's underlining of the last line in pencil and inscribing a question mark in the right margin, with the author presumably indicating a problem area to be resolved. The editors go on to narrate the site's further revisions. MEL offers another revision scenario arguing that the underlining and marginal question mark may have come later, as the indication of a restoration of the original line and of Melville's indecision about which final reading he wanted. In the other revision steps at this revision site, MEL's and NN's revisions sequencings generally agree. The MEL sequencing is that Melville would have first struck through the original, printed line and inscribed beneath it a new line "Manassas' second throe and deadlier share". The line presents metrical problems because it adds a fifth beat to the original tetrameter, and even a sixth depending on how the possessive "Manassas'" is pronounced. At this time, Melville might have thought better of the possessive, struck through the entire penciled line, and underlined the original print line to indicate its restoration. Later, in darker pencil, Melville landed upon a third option: "Thy second shock, Manassas, share." Tinkering, he then struck out "second" and inscribed "after" above it to give "Thy after shock, Manassas, share." Though "after shock" (as in an earthquake) is a new and vibrant image, the deletion of "second" diminishes the irony of the troops enduring the more disastrous second battle of Manassas to come. Having to weigh the losses and gains of his revisions, Melville might have added the marginal question mark to indicate his indecision about this optional line.
