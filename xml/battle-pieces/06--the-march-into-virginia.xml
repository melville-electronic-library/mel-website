<l>Did all the lets and bars appear</l>
<l rend="2em">To every just or larger end,</l>
<l>Whence should come the trust and cheer?</l>

<l>Age finds place in the rear.</l>
	<l rend="2em">All wars are boyish, and are fought by boys,</l>
<l>The champions and enthusiasts of the state:</l>
	<l rend="2em">Turbid ardors and vain joys</l>

<l>Stimulants to the power mature,</l>

		<note xml:id="ref_20558">In "The March into Virginia," Melville shows us the distinction between "fate" and "Fate." The lowercase use of the word indicates an unguided future. Whereas his use of "Fate" includes an element of the supernatural, whether it be the Greek Fates alluded to in "Apathy and Enthusiasm" or Lee's insistence that "the North and South were driven by Fate to arms" in "Lee in the Capitol." <!-- need to fix cross-refs --></note>.</l>

<l>Who here forecasteth the event?</l>
<l>What heart but spurns at precedent</l>
<l>And warnings of the wise,</l>

"If Luther's day expand to Darwin's year, Shall that exclude the hope—foreclose the fear?"</note> of surprise?</l>

<l>The air is blue and <ref target="#ref_20559">prodigal</ref><note xml:id="ref_20559">Cohen connects "prodigal" with the parable of the Prodigal Son from Luke 15.11-32 (213). Melville sees a "boyish" yearning within these young soldiers to learn about war through experience, despite the "warnings of the wise."</note>.

<l rend="2em">No berrying party, pleasure-wooed,</l>

Melville's use of Fate at the end of the verse is important. It tells us that there is the feeling of a supernatural force that is leading these young men toward their Fates. Melville gives us one horrific possibility for this supernatural source in the next verse: Moloch. </note>,

Melville may have, as Cohen mentions, been thinking about the roll call in <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>: "First Moloch, horrid King besmear'd with blood / Of human sacrifice, and parents' tears" (213).</note>;

Then he explicitly lined through the printed line and penciled, then lined through, 'Manassas' second throe and deadlier share'; then he penciled, below, 'Thy second shock, Manassas, share', and finally he substituted 'after' for 'second'.(627)</note></l>
