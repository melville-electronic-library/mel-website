					<l><hi rend="smallcaps">Some</hi> hearts there are of deeper sort,</l>
					<l rend="2em">Prophetic, sad,</l>
					<l>Which yet for cause are trebly clad;</l>
					<l rend="2em">Known death they fly on:</l>
					<l n="5">This wizard-heart and heart-of-oak had Lyon.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>"They are more than twenty thousand strong,</l>
					<l rend="2em">We less than five,</l>
					<l>Too few with such a host to strive.”</l>
					<l rend="2em">“Such counsel, fie on!</l>
					<l n="10">&apos;Tis battle, or &apos;tis shame;” and firm stood Lyon.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg><l>&quot;For help at need in vain we wait—</l>
					<l rend="2em">Retreat or fight:</l>
					<l>Retreat the foe would take for flight,</l>
					<l rend="2em">And each proud scion</l>
					<l n="15">Feel more elate; the end must come,&quot; said. <pb facs="/images/battle-pieces-v1/battle-pieces-i-0033.jpg"/></l>
				</lg>

				<lg>
					<l>By candlelight he wrote the will,</l>
					<l rend="2em">And left his all</l>
					<l>To <ref target="#ref_20245">Her</ref><note xml:id="ref_20245">Lyon was reported to have willed his estate to the United States.</note> for whom &apos;twas not enough to fall;</l>
					<l rend="2em">Loud neighed Orion</l>
					<l n="20">Without the tent; drums beat; we marched with Lyon.</l>
				</lg>

				<lg>
					<l>The night-tramp done, we spied the Vale</l>
					<l rend="2em">With guard-fires lit;</l>
					<l>Day broke, but trooping clouds made gloom of it:</l>
					<l rend="2em">“A field to die on,”</l>
					<l n="25">Presaged in his unfaltering heart, brave Lyon.</l>
				</lg>

				<lg>
					<l>We fought on the grass, we bled in the corn—</l>
					<l rend="2em">Fate seemed malign;</l>
					<l>His horse the Leader led along the line—</l>
					<l rend="2em">Star-browed Orion;</l>
					<l n="30">Bitterly fearless, he rallied us there, brave Lyon.</l>
				</lg>

				<lg>
					<l>There came a sound like the slitting of air</l>
					<l rend="2em">By a swift sharp sword—</l>
					<l>A rush of the sound; and the sleek chest broad</l>
					<l rend="2em">Of black Orion</l>
					<l n="35">Heaved, and was fixed; the dead mane waved toward Lyon. <pb facs="/images/battle-pieces-v1/battle-pieces-i-0034.jpg"/></l>
				</lg>

				<lg>
					<l>“General, you&apos;re hurt—this sleet of balls!”</l>
					<l rend="2em">He seemed half spent;</l>
					<l>With moody and bloody brow, he lowly bent:</l>
					<l rend="2em">“The field to die on;</l>
					<l n="40">But not—not yet; the day is long,” breathed Lyon.</l>
				</lg>

				<lg>
					<l>For a time becharmed there fell a lull</l>
					<l rend="2em">In the heart of the fight;</l>
					<l>The tree-tops nod, the slain sleep light;</l>
					<l rend="2em">Warm noon-winds sigh on,</l>
					<l n="45">And thoughts which he never spake had Lyon.</l>
				</lg>

				<lg>
					<l>Texans and Indians trim for a charge:</l>
					<l rend="2em">“Stand ready, men!</l>
					<l>Let them come close, right up, and then</l>
					<l rend="2em">After the lead, the iron;</l>
					<l n="50">Fire, and charge back!” So strength returned to Lyon.</l>
				</lg>

					<l n="55">“Men! <hi rend="italic">I</hi> will lead,” and a light glared in Lyon. <pb facs="/images/battle-pieces-v1/battle-pieces-i-0035.jpg"/></l>

					<l>On they came: they yelped, and fired;</l>
					<l rend="2em">His spirit sped;</l>
					<l>We leveled right in, and the half-breeds fled,</l>
					<l rend="2em">Nor stayed the iron,</l>
					<l n="60">Nor captured the crimson corse of Lyon.</l>
