           Prophetic, sad,
Which yet for cause are trebly clad;
           Known death they fly on:
This wizard-heart and heart-of-oak had Lyon.
                                                                                                                                                                          
“They are more than twenty <add>thousand</add> strong,
           We less than five,
Too few with such a host to strive.”
           “Such counsel, fie on!
&apos;Tis battle, or &apos;tis shame;” and firm stood Lyon.
                                                                                                                                                                             
&quot;For help at need in vain we wait—
           Retreat or fight:
Retreat the foe would take for flight,
           And each proud scion
Feel more elate; the end must come,&quot; said Lyon<pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1437778854810-z24m7gulsaif6r-86820a35aab0d3e0ab401d7c9e483fcb%2Fmodbm_ac85_m4977_866b_c_0035.jpg"/>By candlelight he wrote the will,
           And left his all
To <ref target="#ref_20245">Her</ref><note xml:id="ref_20245">Lyon was reported to have willed his estate to the United States.</note> for whom &apos;twas not enough to fall;
           Loud neighed Orion
Without the tent; drums beat; <ref target="#ref_20246">we</ref><note xml:id="ref_20246">This is one of the rare moments in Melville's Civil War Poetry when the speaker appears to be a common soldier.</note> marched with Lyon.
                                                                                                                                                                          
The night-tramp done, we spied the Vale
           With guard-fires lit;
Day broke, but trooping clouds made gloom of it:
           “A field to die on,”
Presaged in his unfaltering heart, brave Lyon.
                                                                                                                                                                               
We fought on the grass, we bled in the corn—
           Fate seemed malign;
His horse the Leader led along the line—
           Star-browed Orion;
Bitterly fearless, he rallied us there, brave Lyon.
                                                                                                                                                                             
There came a sound like the slitting of air
           By a swift sharp sword—
A rush of the sound; and the sleek chest broad
           Of black Orion
Heaved, and was fixed; the dead mane waved toward Lyon.

           He seemed half spent;
With moody and bloody brow, he lowly bent:
           “The field to die on;
But not—not yet; the day is long,” breathed Lyon.
                                                                                                                                                                            
For a time becharmed there fell a lull
           In the heart of the fight;
The tree-tops nod, the slain sleep light;
           Warm noon-winds sigh on,
And thoughts which he never spake had Lyon.

           “Stand ready, men!
Let them come close, right up, and then
           After the lead, the iron;
Fire, and charge back!” So strength returned to Lyon.
                                                                                                                                                                           
<name type="person">The Iowa men</name> who held the van,

To battle: “Some one lead us, then we&apos;ll do,”
           Said Corporal Tryon:
“Men! <hi rend="italic">I</hi> will lead,” and a light glared in Lyon.
