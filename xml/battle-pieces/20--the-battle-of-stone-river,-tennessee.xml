A View from <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:468" type="place">Oxford</name> Cloisters.

(January, 1863.)

In days to come the field shall blend,
The story dim and date obscure;
In legend all shall end.
Even now, involved in forest shade
A Druid-dream the strife appears,
The fray of yesterday assumes
The haziness of years.
In North and South still beats the vein

For Sway, but named the name of Right;
And Passion, scorning pain and death,
Lent sacred fervor to the fight.
Each lifted up a broidered cross,
While crossing blades profaned the sign;

And sisters scarfs could twine.
Do North and South the sin retain
Of Yorkist and Lancastrian?

And, deep in denser cypress gloom,
Dark <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:189" type="person">Breckinridge</name>, shall fade away
Or thinly loom.
The pale throngs who in forest cowed
Before the spell of battle&apos;s pause,
Forefelt the stillness that shall dwell
On them and on their wars.
North and South shall join the train
Of Yorkist and Lancastrian.

And then been turned within the wound
By deadly Hate; where Climes contend
On vasty ground—
No warning <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:129" type="place">Alps</name> or seas between,
And small the curb of creed or law,
And blood is quick, and quick the brain;
Shall North and South their rage deplore,
And reunited thrive amain
Like Yorkist and Lancastrian?
