					<note xml:id="ref_20938">To prepare for the siege of Vicksburg, Union ships headed upstream to anchor north of Vicksburg, passing Southern gun placements on shore.</note>
<note xml:id="ref_20940">Usually spelled Vicksburg, this rivertown on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi was the last Southern stronghold against the Northern strategy of controlling the river in order to split the Confederacy. The siege of Vicksburg, beginning mid-May 1863 in the month after the poem's setting, lasted six weeks.</note>

<l><hi rend="smallcaps">A moonless</hi> night—a friendly one;</l>
<l rend="2em">A haze dimmed the shadowy shore</l>

<l rend="2em">The secret like a burden laid.</l>
<l>The first boat melts; and a second keel</l>

A flame leaps out; they are seen;</l>
<l rend="2em">Another and another gun roars;</l>
<l>We tell the course of the boats through the screen</l>
<l rend="2em">By each further fort that pours,</l>

<l>How we strain our gaze. On bluffs they shun</l>
<l rend="2em">A golden growing flame appears—</l>

				<l rend="2em">And glade of death the beacon throws</l>
<l>Athwart the racing waters there;</l>

	<l>Fearless they flash through gates of flame,</l>
<l rend="2em">The salamanders hard to hit,</l>

<l rend="2em">And never the batteries intermit,</l>

<lg>
	<l>Anon a lull. The beacon dies:</l>

<l>But other flames now dawning rise,</l>
				<l rend="2em">Not mellowly brilliant like the first,</l>

	<l>The effulgence takes an amber glow</l>
