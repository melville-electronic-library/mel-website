in <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:526" type="place">a field of Georgia</name></ref><note xml:id="ref_20953">[Title Note] As suggested by its placement in the section titled, “Verses Inscriptive and Memorial,” On a Natural Monument” is a commemorative poem to the Union prisoners of war at Andersonville Prison, where approximately 15,000 died (Garner, 368). 

[Criticism—Canonical] Robert Penn Warren notes that this poem “completes the little cluster of three poems dealing with the death of the ‘nameless’” (Warren, 378).

[Circulation] Ian Frederick Finseth’s 2006 book, The American Civil War: An Anthology of Essential Writings, lists “On a Natural Monument” in a section titled Remembrance and Forgetting, which also includes Battle-Pieces poems: “An Uninscribed Monument” and “A Requiem.”

[Source] The author of the editorial cites the protruding bones of the dead as the “natural monuments of fiendish cruelty” ("The Andersonville Torturers." New York Times (1857-1922): 2. ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The New York Times (1851-2008). Aug 08 1865.)

  And stands where here the field immures
The nameless brave whose palms are won.
Outcast they sleep; yet fame is nigh—
  Pure fame of deeds, not doers;
Nor <ref target="#ref_20929">deeds</ref><note xml:id="ref_20929">DEEDS [Denotation] In conjunction with “fame of deeds” in line 5, “deeds” in line 6 refers to “exploit[s]” and “illustrious act[s].” However, the term also references a legal “contract or agreement,” especially one “conveying real estate to a purchaser or donee” (An American Dictionary of the English Language, 1846). This latter definition may be relevant to the dead’s designation as “[o]utcast” (line 4) from their native or earthly real estate and anticipates the Miltonic simile (beginning with “As men in gales shun the lee shore”, line 16) in which the speaker describes the dead’s displacement from the  “homestead” on the “lee shore" (line 17).

  In cheer of hymns that round them float:
In happy dreams such close the eye.
But withering famine slowly wore,
  And slowly fell disease did gloat.
Even Nature&apos;s self did aid deny;
They choked in horror the pensive sigh.
  Yea, off from home sad Memory bore
<ref target="#ref_19281">(Though anguished Yearning heaved that way)</ref><note xml:id="ref_19281">THOUGH ANGUISHED YEARNING HEAVED THAT WAY [Reference—historical] [Source]: Augustus C. Hamlin, identified as “Late Medical Inspector U.S. Army, Antiquarian,” conveys a similar sentiment of soldiers’s anguish in remembering home in his 1866 book, Martyr; or Andersonville Prison“: Food was demanded, but it was wanting. Shelter and the pure air of heaven were prayed for by gasping men; even these, too, were wanting. Yet close by rose the gigantic pines, of the growth of centuries, standing in all the grandeur of the primeval forests, and offering to the disordered vision and senses of the dying wretches grateful shades, cool bowers, or the images of home, and the forms of the well-loved, as the faint and sinking traveller beholds them in the far-off mirage of the desert.”

[Intratextuality] Refer to Chapter 23 “The Lee Shore” in Moby-Dick: “But as in landlessness alone resides highest truth, shoreless, indefinite as God—so better is it to perish in that howling infinite, than be ingloriously dashed upon the lee, even if that were safety!"

Though there the homestead be, and call,
And thitherward winds and waters sway—
As such lorn mariners, so fared they.</ref><note xml:id="ref_19282">AS MEN...SO FARED THEY [Poetics—Simile] Lines 16-20 is an example of a Miltonic epic simile, which is defined by its restrained length that typically represents a concrete and particular experience and that often advances a brief fable that ennobles its subject. See James Whaler’s “The Miltonic Simile” (1931) and L. D. Lerner’s “The Miltonic Simile” (1954) for further discussion and definition of Milton’s similes.;

[Intratextuality] [Reference—nautical] A similar nautically themed simile appears in the Battle-Pieces poem “Gettysburg: The Check”: “Before our lines it seemed a beach / Which wild September gales have strewn / With havoc on wreck, and dashed therewith / Pale Crews unknown— / Men, arms, and steeds” (lines 19-23).

  Their fame is this: they did endure—
Endure, when fortitude was vain
To kindle any approving strain
Which they might hear. To these who rest,
  This healing sleep alone was sure.</p></div></body>
