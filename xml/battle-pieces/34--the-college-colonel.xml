Wounded again, he returned to Pittsfield, his arm in a sling, to lead his regiment—reduced by a third—in a parade on August 22, 1863, around the time Melville and his family were preparing to relocate to New York City. Returning to battle, Bartlett was wounded again (in the Battle of the Wilderness), and again (in the Battle of the Crater), where he was captured and spent two months in Libby Prison. At war’s end, he was 25 and returned to Pittsfield where he married and raised a family of six children.
