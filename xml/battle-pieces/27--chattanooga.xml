The poem's last stanza (which does not appear in the <hi rend="italic">Harper’s</hi> version) was derived from "Inscription for the Slain at Fredericksburgh"; see Revision Narrative below for a fuller account. The poem itself treats the Chattanooga Campaign of October/November, 1863, in which, after significant losses on both sides, Grant's Union forces seized control of the Tennessee River by taking the central transportation hub of the rivertown Chattanooga. Union victory was achieved when Grant deployed regiments against Confederate artillery strongholds on the surrounding heights of the city, first taking Lookout Mountain and then Missionary Ridge, on November 24 and 25th, respectively. A likely source for reports of Union cheering and the dead is from <hi rend="italic">The Rebellion Record</hi> 8: 235 (NN <hi rend="italic">Published Poems</hi> 645-46).

<p>Although the month was November, the day was in character an October one—cool, clear, bright, intoxicatingly invigorating; one of those days peculiar to the ripest hour of our American autumn. This weather must have had much to do with the spontaneous enthusiasm which seized the troops—an enthusiasm aided, doubtless, by glad thoughts of the victory of Look-out Mountain won the day previous, and also by the elation attending the capture, after a fierce struggle, of the long ranges of rifle-pits at the mountain's base, where orders for the time should have stopped the advance. But there and then it was that the army took the bit between its teeth, and ran away with the generals to the victory commemorated. General Grant, at Culpepper, a few weeks prior to crossing the Rapidan for the Wilderness, expressed to a visitor his impression of the impulse and the spectacle: Said he, "I never saw any thing like it:" <pb facs="/images/battle-pieces-v1/battle-pieces-i-0258.jpg"/> language which seems curiously undertoned, considering its application; but from the taciturn Commander it was equivalent to a superlative or hyperbole from the talkative.
</p><p>The height of the Ridge, according to the account at hand, varies along its length from six to seven hundred feet above the plain; it slopes at an angle of about forty-five degrees.</p>

<p xml:id="BP_EDnoteChattanoogaRN1"><hi rend="smallcaps">Editors’ Revision Narrative.</hi></p>
<p>The poem Melville finally titled “Chattanooga” exists in six versions—in ink (twice), facsimile, magazine, book, and pencil—documented throughout NN <hi rend="italics">Published Poems</hi> (66-68, 321, 645-47, and 866-67). The first two are manuscript versions of a separate poem containing wordings that end up in the last stanza of “Chattanooga.”
</p>
<p>
(1) The first manuscript version is the six-line “Inscription For the Slain at Fredericksburgh” (transcribed below), which Melville submitted, as early as January 1864, in response to a request by Alexander Bliss and John Pendleton Kennedy for his contribution of an “autograph” (i.e. handwritten) poem to be photo-reproduced in their collection of facsimiles of poems by other celebrated writers, titled <hi rend="italics">Our Country’s Authors</hi> (Baltimore, [April] 1864). The poem memorializes the Battle of Fredericksburg, Virginia (December 13-15, 1862), a bloody Union defeat.
</p>

<l rend="2em"><hi rend="italic">At Fredericksburgh</hi>.</l>
<l rend="4em">——— * ——</l>
<l>A glory lights an earnest end; </l>
<l>In jubilee the patriot ghosts ascend.</l>
<l>Transfigured at the rapturous height</l>
<l>Of their passionate feat of arms,</l>
<l>Death to the brave’s a starry night,— </l>
<l>Strown their vale of death with palms.</l><lb/>
<l rend="10em">Herman Melville</l>
</lg>
<p>
(2) On March 22, 1864, Melville submitted a revised manuscript version of this poem, with “Slain” in the title changed to “Dead,” “glory” modified to “dreadful glory,” and “Strown” corrected to “Strewn.” His intention was that this revision would be substituted in Bliss and Kennedy’s compendium for the original.
</p>
<p>
 (3) However, the original manuscript (as displayed and transcribed above) was already in production, and the original (not the revised version) appeared in Bliss and Kennedy’s <hi rend="italics">Our Country’s Authors</hi>. Neither version of “Inscription For the Slain/Dead at Fredericksburgh” would appear in <hi rend="italics">Battle-Pieces</hi>. (Instead, Melville included the seven-line “Inscription for Marye’s Heights, Fredericksburg,” which memorializes the battle’s bloodiest encounter.)
</p>
<p>
 (4) The 1866 battle-piece “Chattanooga,” which focuses on the Union victory in the Chattanooga Campaign of late fall 1863, is linked to Melville’s 1864 “Inscription For the Slain/Dead” because the last stanza of the later poem draws wording directly from the earlier poem, especially the moving image of death as “a starry night.” “Chattanooga” first appeared in the June 1866 issue of <hi rend="italics">Harper’s New Monthly Magazine</hi> (33: 44) but, curiously, the “starry night” stanza does not appear. Either it was omitted for reasons of space, or Melville added it before its reappearance in <hi rend="italics">Battle-Pieces</hi>.
</p>
<p>
(5) Apart from the addition of the “starry night” final stanza, the only other substantive changes in the <hi rend="italics">Battle-Pieces</hi> print version of “Chattanooga” are the addition of the sub-title’s dateline of “(<hi rend="smallcaps">November,</hi> 1863),” which does not appear in the <hi rend="italics">Harper’s</hi> version and the revision of the <hi rend="italics">Harper’s</hi> phrasing “October air” to the <hi rend="italics">Battle-Pieces</hi> phrase “elastic air” in line 2. The magazine and book versions also differ in 25 places regarding punctuation and capitalization.
</p>
<p>
(6) In the left margin next to line 54 of his Copy C of  <hi rend="italics">Battle-Pieces</hi>, Melville inscribed “foemen” in pencil as a possible alternate wording for “rebels.” <pb facs="/images/battle-pieces-v2/battle-pieces-ii-0102.jpg"/>
