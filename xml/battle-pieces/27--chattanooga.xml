<l>Their hearts outran their General&apos;s plan,</l>
<l rend="2em">Though <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:149" type="person">Grant</name> commanded there—</l>
<l n="5" rend="2em">Grant, who without reserve can dare;</l>

<l rend="2em">He said, and measured the <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:476" type="place">mountain</name> then:</l>
<l>So master-riders fling the rein—</l>
<l rend="2em">But you must know your men.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10">On yester-morn in grayish mist,</l>
<l rend="2em">Armies like ghosts on hills had fought,</l>
<l>And rolled from the cloud their thunders loud</l>
<l rend="2em">The <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:477" type="place">Cumberlands</name> far had caught:</l>
<l rend="2em">To-day the sunlit steeps are sought.</l>
<l n="15">Grant stood on cliffs whence all was plain,</l>
<l rend="2em">And smoked as one who feels no cares;</l>
<l>But mastered nervousness intense</l>
<l rend="2em">Alone such calmness wears. <pb facs="/images/battle-pieces-v1/battle-pieces-i-0099.jpg"/></l>

<lg>
<l>The summit-cannon plunge their flame</l>
<l n="20" rend="2em">Sheer down the primal wall,</l>
<l>But up and up each linking troop</l>
<l rend="2em">In stretching festoons crawl—</l>
<l rend="2em">Nor fire a shot. Such men appall</l>
<l>The foe, though brave. He, from the brink,</l>
<l n="25" rend="2em">Looks far along the breadth of slope,</l>
<l>And sees two miles of dark dots creep,</l>
<l rend="2em">And knows they mean the cope.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>He sees them creep. Yet here and there</l>
<l rend="2em">Half hid &apos;mid leafless groves they go;</l>
<l n="30">As men who ply through traceries high</l>
<l rend="2em">Of turreted marbles show—</l>
<l rend="2em">So dwindle these to eyes below.</l>
<l>But fronting shot and flanking shell</l>
<l rend="2em">Sliver and rive the inwoven ways;</l>
<l n="35">High tops of oaks and high hearts fall,</l>
<l rend="2em">But never the climbing stays.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>From right to left, from left to right</l>
<l rend="2em">They roll the rallying cheer—</l>
<l>Vie with each other, brother with brother,</l>
<l n="40" rend="2em">Who shall the first appear—</l>
<l rend="2em">What color-bearer with colors clear</l>
<l>In sharp relief, like sky-drawn Grant, <pb facs="/images/battle-pieces-v1/battle-pieces-i-0100.jpg"/></l>
<l rend="2em">Whose cigar must now be near the stump—</l>
<l>While in solicitude his back</l>
<l n="45" rend="2em">Heaps slowly to a hump.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Near and more near; till now the flags</l>
<l rend="2em">Run like a catching flame;</l>
<l>And one flares highest, to peril nighest—</l>
<l rend="2em"><hi rend="italic">He</hi> means to make a name:</l>
<l n="50" rend="2em">Salvos! they give him his fame.</l>
<l>The staff is caught, and next the rush,</l>

<l>Flag answered flag along the crest,</l>
<l rend="2em">And swarms of rebels fled.</l>

<l rend="2em">And—eager, ardent, earnest there—</l>
<l>Dropped into Death&apos;s wide-open arms,</l>
<l rend="2em">Quelled on the wing like eagles struck in air—</l>
<l rend="2em">Forever they slumber young and fair,</l>

<p>Although the month was November, the day was in character an October one—cool, clear, bright, intoxicatingly invigorating; one of those days peculiar to the ripest hourw of our American autumn. This weather must have had much to do with the spontaneous enthusiasm which seized the troops—an enthusiasm aided, doubtless, by glad thoughts of the victory of Look-out Mountain won the day previous, and also by the elation attending the capture, after a fierce struggle, of the long ranges of rifle-pits at the mountain's base, where orders for the time should have stopped the advance. But there and then it was that the army took the bit between its teeth, and ran away with the generals to the victory commemorated. General Grant, at Culpepper, a few weeks prior to crossing the Rapidan for the Wilderness, expressed to a visitor his impression of the impulse and the spectacle: Said he, "I never saw any thing like it:" <pb facs="/images/battle-pieces-v1/battle-pieces-i-0258.jpg"/> language which seems curiously undertoned, considering its application; but from the taciturn Commander it was equivalent to a superlative or hyperbole from the talkative.
</p><p>The height of the Ridge, according to the account at hand, varies along its length from six to seven hundred feet above the plain; it slopes at an angle of about forty-five degrees.</p>
