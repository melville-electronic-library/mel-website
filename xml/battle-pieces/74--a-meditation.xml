<head type="sub-head"><lg><l>ATTRIBUTED TO A NORTHERNER AFTER ATTENDING THE</l>
<l>LAST OF TWO FUNERALS FROM THE SAME HOMESTEAD—</l>
<l>THOSE OF A NATIONAL AND A CONFEDERATE OFFICER</l>
<l>(BROTHERS), HIS KINSMEN, WHO HAD DIED FROM THE EF-</l>
<l>FECTS OF WOUNDS RECEIVED IN THE CLOSING BATTLES.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l><hi rend="smallcaps">How</hi> often in the years that close,</l>
<l rend="2em">When truce had stilled the sieging gun,</l>
<l>The soldiers, mounting on their works,</l>
<l rend="2em">With mutual curious glance have run</l>
<l>From face to face along the fronting show,</l>
<l>And kinsman spied, or friend—even in a foe.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>What thoughts conflicting then were shared.</l>
<l rend="2em">While sacred tenderness perforce</l>
<l>Welled from the heart and wet the eye;</l>
<l n="10" rend="2em">And something of a strange remorse</l>
<l>Rebelled against the sanctioned sin of blood,</l>
<l>And Christian wars of natural brotherhood.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Then stirred the god within the breast—</l>
<l rend="2em">The witness that is man&apos;s at birth;</l>
<l>A deep misgiving undermined</l>
<l rend="2em">Each plea and subterfuge of earth;</l>
<l>They felt in that rapt pause, with warning rife,</l>
<l>Horror and anguish for the civil strife.</l></lg>

<pb facs="/images/battle-pieces-v1/battle-pieces-i-0250.jpg"/>
<lg>
<l>Of North or South they recked not then,</l>
<l n="20" rend="2em">Warm passion cursed the cause of war:</l>
<l>Can Africa pay back this blood</l>
<l rend="2em">Spilt on Potomac&apos;s shore?</l>
<l>Yet doubts, as pangs, were vain the strife to stay,</l>
<l>And hands that fain had clasped again could slay.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>How frequent in the camp was seen</l>
<l rend="2em">The herald from the hostile one,</l>
<l>A guest and frank companion there</l>
<l rend="2em">When the proud formal talk was done;</l>
<l>The pipe of peace was smoked even &apos;mid the war,</l>
<l n="30">And fields in Mexico again fought o&apos;er.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>In Western battle long they lay</l>
<l rend="2em">So near opposed in trench or pit,</l>
<l>That foeman unto foeman called</l>
<l rend="2em">As men who screened in tavern sit:</l>
<l>&quot;You bravely fight&quot; each to the other said—</l>
<l>&quot;Toss us a biscuit!&quot; o&apos;er the wall it sped.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And pale on those same slopes, a boy—</l>
<l rend="2em">A stormer, bled in noon-day glare;</l>
<l>No aid the <name type="person">Blue-coats</name> then could bring,</l>
<l n="40" rend="2em">He cried to them who nearest were,</l>
<l>And out there came &apos;mid howling shot and shell</l>
<l>A daring foe who him befriended well.</l></lg>

<pb facs="/images/battle-pieces-v1/battle-pieces-i-0251.jpg"/>
<lg>
<l>Mark the great Captains on both sides,</l>
<l rend="2em">The soldiers with the broad renown—</l>
<l>They all were <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:497" type="event">messmates on the Hudson&apos;s marge</name>,</l>
<l rend="2em">Beneath one roof they laid them down;</l>
<l>And, free from hate in many an after pass,</l>
<l>Strove as in school-boy rivalry of the class.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>A darker side there is; but doubt</l>
<l n="50" rend="2em">In Nature&apos;s charity hovers there:</l>
<l>If men for new agreement yearn,</l>
<l rend="2em">Then old upbraiding best forbear:</l>
<l>&quot;<hi rend="italic">The South&apos;s the sinner!</hi>  &quot; Well, so let it be;</l>
<l>But shall the North sin worse, and stand the <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:213" type="person">Pharisee</name>?</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>O, now that brave men yield the sword,</l>
<l rend="2em">Mine be the manful soldier-view;</l>
<l>By how much more they boldly warred,</l>
<l rend="2em">By so much more is mercy due:</l>
<l>When <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/event:30" type="event">Vicksburg fell</name>, and the moody files marched out,</l>
<l n="60">Silent the victors stood, scorning to raise a shout.</l></lg>
