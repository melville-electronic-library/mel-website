(October, 1864)

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Palely intent, he urged his keel
  Full on the guns, and touched the spring;
Himself involved in the bolt he drove
Timed with the armed hull&apos;s shot that stove
His <ref target="#ref_20990">shallop</ref><note xml:id="ref_20990">[definition] [nautical] From Merriam- Webster: A usually 2-masted ship with lugsails. Or, a small open boat propelled by oars or sails and used chiefly in shallow waters.</note>—die or do!
Into the flood his life he threw,
  Yet lives—unscathed—a breathing thing
To marvel at.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">              He has his fame;
But that mad dash at death, how name?

  From the martyr-passion? Could he dare
Disdain the Paradise of opening joy
  Which beckons the fresh heart every where?
Life has more lures than any girl
  For youth and strength; puts forth a share

And ever with unfathomable eyes,
    Which baffingly entice,
Still strangely does <ref target="#ref_19266">Adonis</ref><note xml:id="ref_19266">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adonis [reference, mythological]</note> draw.
And life once over, who shall tell the rest?
Life is, of all we know, <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:132" type="person">God</name>&apos;s best.
What imps these eagles then, that they
Fling disrespect on life by that proud way
In which they soar above our lower clay.

  In <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/artwork:916" type="artwork"><name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:204" type="person">Cushing</name></name>&apos;s eager deed was shown
  A spirit which brave poets own—
That scorn of life which earns life&apos;s crown;
  Earns, but not always wins; but he—
  The star ascended in his nativity.
