<lg>
<l><hi rend="smallcaps">O mystery</hi> of noble hearts,</l>
<l rend="2em">To whom mysterious seas have been</l>
<l>In midnight watches, lonely calm and storm,</l>
<l rend="4em">A stern, sad discipline,</l>
<l n="5">And rooted out the false and vain,</l>
<l rend="2em">And chastened them to aptness for</l>
<l rend="2em">Devotion and the deeds of war,</l>
<l>And death which smiles and cheers in spite of pain.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Beyond the bar the land-wind dies,</l>
<l n="10" rend="2em">The prows becharmed at anchor swim:</l>
<l>A summer night; the stars withdrawn look down—</l>
<l rend="4em">Fair eve of battle grim.</l>
<l>The sentries pace, bonetas glide;</l>
<l rend="2em">Below, the sleeping sailors swing,</l>
<l n="15" rend="2em">And in their dreams to quarters spring,</l>
<l>Or cheer their flag, or breast a stormy tide.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l><pb facs="/images/battle-pieces-v1/battle-pieces-i-0119.jpg"/>
But drums are beat: <hi rend="italic">Up anchor all!</hi></l>
<l rend="2em">The triple lines steam slowly on;</l>
<l>Day breaks, and through the sweep of decks each man</l>
<l n="20" rend="4em">Stands coldly by his gun—</l>
<l>As cold as it. But he shall warm—</l>
<l rend="2em">Warm with the solemn metal there,</l>
<l rend="2em">And all its ordered fury share,</l>
<l>In attitude a gladiatorial form.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="25">The Admiral—yielding to the love</l>
<l rend="2em">Which held his life and ship so dear—</l>
<l>Sailed second in the long fleet&apos;s midmost line;</l>
<l rend="4em">Yet thwarted all their care:</l>
<l>He <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/artwork:996" type="artwork">lashed himself aloft</name>, and shone</l>
<l n="30" rend="2em">Star of the fight, with influence sent</l>
<l rend="2em">Throughout the dusk embattlement;</l>
<l>And so they neared the strait and walls of stone.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>No sprightly fife as in the field,</l>
<l rend="2em">The decks were hushed like fanes in prayer;</l>
<l n="35">Behind each man a holy angel stood—</l>
<l rend="4em">He stood, though none was &apos;ware.</l>
<l>Out spake the forts on either hand,</l>
<l rend="2em">Back speak the ships when spoken to,</l>
<l rend="2em"><pb facs="/images/battle-pieces-v1/battle-pieces-i-0120.jpg"/>
And set their flags in concert true,</l>
<l n="40">And <hi rend="italic">On and in!</hi> is <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:192" type="person">Farragut</name>&apos;s command.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>But what delays? &apos;mid wounds above</l>
<l rend="2em">Dim buoys give hint of death below—</l>
<l>Sea-ambuscades, where evil art had aped</l>
<l rend="4em">Hecla that hides in snow.</l>
<l n="45">The centre-van, entangled, trips;</l>
<l rend="2em">The starboard leader holds straight on:</l>
<l rend="2em">A cheer for the Tecumseh!—nay,</l>
<l>Before their eyes the turreted ship goes down!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The fire redoubles, While the fleet</l>
<l n="50" rend="2em">Hangs dubious—ere the horror ran—</l>
<l>The Admiral rushes to his rightful place—</l>
<l rend="4em">Well met! apt hour and man!—</l>
<l>Closes with peril, takes the lead,</l>
<l rend="2em">His action is a stirring call;</l>
<l n="55" rend="2em">He strikes his great heart through them all,</l>
<l>And is the genius of their daring deed.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The forts are daunted, slack their fire,</l>
<l rend="2em">Confounded by the deadlier aim</l>
<l><pb facs="/images/battle-pieces-v1/battle-pieces-i-0121.jpg"/>
And rapid broadsides of the speeding fleet,</l>
<l n="60" rend="4em">And fierce denouncing flame.</l>
<l>Yet shots from four dark hulls embayed</l>
<l rend="2em">Come raking through the loyal crews,</l>
<l rend="2em">Whom now each dying mate endues</l>
<l>With his last look, anguished yet undismayed.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="65">A flowering time to guilt is given,</l>
<l rend="2em">And traitors have their glorying hour;</l>
<l>O late, but sure, the righteous Paramount comes—</l>
<l rend="4em">Palsy is on their power!</l>
<l>So proved it with the rebel keels,</l>
<l n="70" rend="2em">The strong-holds past: assailed, they run;</l>
<l rend="2em">The Selma strikes, and the work is done:</l>
<l>The dropping anchor the achievement seals.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>But no, she turns—the Tennessee!</l>
<l rend="2em">The solid Ram of iron and oak,</l>
<l n="75">Strong as Evil, and bold as Wrong, though lone—</l>
<l rend="4em">A pestilence in her smoke.</l>
<l>The flag-ship is her singled mark,</l>
<l rend="2em">The wooden Hartford. Let her come;</l>
<l rend="2em"> She challenges the planet of Doom,</l>
<l n="80">And naught shall save her—not her iron bark.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l><pb facs="/images/battle-pieces-v1/battle-pieces-i-0122.jpg"/>
<hi rend="italic">Slip anchor, all! and at her, all!</hi></l>
<l rend="2em"><hi rend="italic">Bear down with rushing beaks—and</hi> now!</l>
<l>First the Monongahela struck—and reeled;</l>
<l rend="4em">The Lackawana&apos;s prow</l>
<l n="85">Next crashed—crashed, but not crashing; then</l>
<l rend="2em">The Admiral rammed, and rasping nigh</l>
<l rend="2em">Sloped in a broadside, which glanced by:</l>
<l>The Monitors battered at her adamant den.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The Chickasaw plunged beneath the stern</l>
<l n="90" rend="2em">And pounded there; a huge wrought orb</l>
<l>From the Manhattan pierced one wall, but dropped;</l>
<l rend="4em">Others the seas absorb.</l>
<l>Yet stormed on all sides, narrowed in,</l>
<l rend="2em">Hampered and cramped, the bad one fought—</l>
<l n="95" rend="2em">Spat ribald curses from the port</l>
<l>Who shutters, jammed, locked up this <ref target="#ref_21003">Man-of-Sin</ref><note xml:id="ref_21003">"Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition."  2 Thessalonians 2:3 [Allusion, Biblical] (Shurr, 38)</note>.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>No pause or stay. They made a din</l>
<l rend="2em">Like hammers round a boiler forged;</l>
<l>Now straining strength tangled itself with strength,</l>
<l n="100" rend="4em">Till Hate her will disgorged.</l>
<l>The white flag showed, the fight was won—</l>
<l rend="2em">Mad shouts went up that shook the Bay;</l>
<l rend="2em"><pb facs="/images/battle-pieces-v1/battle-pieces-i-0123.jpg"/>
But pale on the scarred fleet&apos;s decks there lay</l>
<l>A silent man for every silenced gun.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="105">And quiet far below the wave,</l>
<l rend="2em">Where never cheers shall move their sleep,</l>
<l>Some who did boldly, nobly earn them, lie—</l>
<l rend="4em">Charmed children of the deep.</l>
<l>But decks that now are in the seed,</l>
<l n="110" rend="2em">And cannon yet within the mine,</l>
<l rend="2em">Shall thrill the deeper, gun and pine,</l>
<l>Because of the Tecumseh&apos;s glorious deed.</l>
