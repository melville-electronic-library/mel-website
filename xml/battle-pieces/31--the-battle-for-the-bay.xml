				<note xml:id="EDnoteBattleBay1">Mobile (Alabama) Bay was the last Confederate port east of the Mississippi River to be taken, and on August 5, 1864, rear Admiral David G. Farragut, commanding a Union fleet of 14 conventional warships and four Monitor-like turreted ironclads, including the Tecumseh, seized the bay enabling the eventual capture of the forts guarding the bay. The smaller confederate fleet consisted of three warships and the Merrimack-style ironclad Tennessee. The bay's entrance was also heavily mined, and the greatest loss of Union sailors in the battle was 93 of Tecumseh's crew of 114 when the ship sank after striking a mine (torpedo). Nevertheless, Farragut ordered his ships into the bay; his famous (somewhat inaccurate) command of "Damn the torpedoes; full speed ahead" was not reported until some years after the end of the war. To get a better view of the conflict from his flagship Hartford, Farragut had himself lashed to an upper mast.</note>

<l rend="2em">To whom mysterious seas have been</l>
<l>In midnight watches, lonely calm and storm,</l>
<l rend="4em">A stern, sad discipline,</l>
<l n="5">And rooted out the false and vain,</l>
<l rend="2em">And chastened them to aptness for</l>
<l rend="2em">Devotion and the deeds of war,</l>
<l>And death which smiles and cheers in spite of pain.</l>

<lg>
<l>Beyond the bar the land-wind dies,</l>
<l n="10" rend="2em">The prows becharmed at anchor swim:</l>
<l>A summer night; the stars withdrawn look down—</l>
<l rend="4em">Fair eve of battle grim.</l>
<l>The sentries pace, bonetas glide;</l>
<l rend="2em">Below, the sleeping sailors swing,</l>
<l n="15" rend="2em">And in their dreams to quarters spring,</l>
<l>Or cheer their flag, or breast a stormy tide. <pb facs="/images/battle-pieces-v1/battle-pieces-i-0119.jpg"/></l>

<l rend="4em">Yet thwarted all their care:</l>
<l>He lashed himself aloft, and shone</l>
<l n="30" rend="2em">Star of the fight, with influence sent</l>
<l rend="2em">Throughout the dusk embattlement;</l>
<l>And so they neared the strait and walls of stone.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>No sprightly fife as in the field,</l>
<l rend="2em">The decks were hushed like fanes in prayer;</l>
<l n="35">Behind each man a holy angel stood—</l>
<l rend="4em">He stood, though none was &apos;ware.</l>
<l>Out spake the forts on either hand,</l>

<l rend="2em">And set their flags in concert true,</l>

<l>But what delays? &apos;mid wounds above</l>

<l rend="2em">The starboard leader holds straight on:</l>
<l rend="2em">A cheer for the Tecumseh!—nay,</l>
<l>Before their eyes the turreted ship goes down!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The fire redoubles, While the fleet</l>
<l n="50" rend="2em">Hangs dubious—ere the horror ran—</l>
<l>The Admiral rushes to his rightful place—</l>
<l rend="4em">Well met! apt hour and man!—</l>
<l>Closes with peril, takes the lead,</l>
<l rend="2em">His action is a stirring call;</l>
<l n="55" rend="2em">He strikes his great heart through them all,</l>
<l>And is the genius of their daring deed.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The forts are daunted, slack their fire,</l>
<l rend="2em">Confounded by the deadlier aim <pb facs="/images/battle-pieces-v1/battle-pieces-i-0121.jpg"/></l>
<l>And rapid broadsides of the speeding fleet,</l>
<l n="60" rend="4em">And fierce denouncing flame.</l>
<l>Yet shots from four dark hulls embayed</l>
<l rend="2em">Come raking through the loyal crews,</l>
<l rend="2em">Whom now each dying mate endues</l>
<l>With his last look, anguished yet undismayed.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="65">A flowering time to guilt is given,</l>
<l rend="2em">And traitors have their glorying hour;</l>
<l>O late, but sure, the righteous Paramount comes—</l>
<l rend="4em">Palsy is on their power!</l>
<l>So proved it with the rebel keels,</l>
<l n="70" rend="2em">The strong-holds past: assailed, they run;</l>
<l rend="2em">The Selma strikes, and the work is done:</l>
<l>The dropping anchor the achievement seals.</l>

<l>But no, she turns—the Tennessee!</l>
<l rend="2em">The solid Ram of iron and oak,</l>
<l n="75">Strong as Evil, and bold as Wrong, though lone—</l>

<l rend="2em">The wooden Hartford. Let her come;</l>

<l rend="2em">The Admiral rammed, and rasping nigh</l>
<l rend="2em">Sloped in a broadside, which glanced by:</l>
<l>The Monitors battered at her adamant den.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The Chickasaw plunged beneath the stern</l>
<l n="90" rend="2em">And pounded there; a huge wrought orb</l>

<l rend="4em">Others the seas absorb.</l>
<l>Yet stormed on all sides, narrowed in,</l>
<l rend="2em">Hampered and cramped, the bad one fought—</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l>No pause or stay. They made a din</l>
