	<note>Note 1: [Historical] [Critical] Confederate troops led by Major General John C. Breckinridge attempted to recapture New Orleans from Union forces. The Maine regiment held their position and the Union forces were able to drive the Confederates off. Both sides suffered major casualties. Garner suggests that Melville’s comparative use of the geographic features of Maine and Louisiana in the poem emphasizes the Maine men’s “true spirit of union”: “[t]hey had risked their lives because, however distant and alien it might seem, this place was still their country” (Garner 181). (Christina Lee)
