The poem “Donelson” depicts the events at Fort Donelson near Dover, Tennessee from February 12, 1862 to February 16, 1862. The Confederate forces surrendered Fort Donelson to General Grant and abandoned its positions in Kentucky and northern Tennessee (Cohen 219).</note></name>.</head><lb/><head type="sub-head">(<hi rend="smallcaps">February</hi>, 1862.)</head>

 A possible reference to the apocalyptic image in the Bible’s Book of Revelations: “10. And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters; 11. And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter” (KJV, Revelation 8:10-11).

                       “We&apos;ll beat in the end, sir,”
                   Firmly said one in staid rebuke,
                   A solid merchant, square and stout.
                       “And do you think it? that way tend, sir?”
                   Asked the lean Copperhead, with a look
                   Of splenetic pity. “Yes, I do.”
                   His yellow death&apos;s head the croaker shook:
                   “The country&apos;s ruined, that I know.”
                   A shower of broken ice and snow,
                       In lieu of words, confuted him;
                   They saw him hustled round the corner go,
                       And each by-stander said—Well suited him.

                   Next day another crowd was seen
                   In the dark weather&apos;s sleety spleen.
                   Bald-headed to the storm came out
                   A man, who, &apos;mid a joyous shout,
                   Silently posted this brief sheet:

                   To him who thus much read aloud.
                   “That&apos;s all,” he said. “What! nothing more?”

                       The Louisville&apos;s wheel was smashed outright.

                       In the narrow stream the Louisville,
                   Unhelmed, grew lawless; swung around
                       And would have thumped and drifted, till
                   All the fleet was driven aground,
                   But for the timely order to retire.

                       With cavalry and artillery, and went
                       In fury at our environment.
                   Under cover of shot and shell
                       Three columns of infantry rolled on
                       Vomited out of Donelson—
                   Rolled down the slopes like rivers of hell,
                       Surged at our line, and swelled and poured
                   like breaking surf. But unsubmerged
                       Our men stood up, except where roared
                   The enemy through one gap. We urged
                   Our all of manhood to the stress,
                   But still showed shattered in our desperateness.

                       Till all became an Indian fight,

                   And strength outlasting theirs,
                       Did our boys at last drive the rebels off.
                   Yet they went not back to their distant lairs
                       In strong-hold, bid loud in scoff

                   Uplands; built works, or stalked around.
                   Our right wing bore this onset. Noon
                   Brought calm to Donelson.</hi>

                   Nature retained her sulking-fit,
                            In her hand the shard.
                   Flitting faces took the hue
                   Of that washed bulletin-board in view,
                   And seemed to bear the public grief
                   As private, and uncertain of relief;
                   Yea, many an earnest heart was won,
                       As broodingly he plodded on,
                   To find in himself some bitter thing,
                   Some hardness in his lot as harrowing

                   Light drifts of men thrown forward, fade
                       In skirmish-line along the slope,
                   Where some dislodgments must be made

                   Next day in large bold hand was seen

                       Following a hat on the point of a sword.
                   Spite shell and round-shot, grape and canister,
                   Up they climbed without rail or banister—
                       Up the steep hill-sides long and broad,
                   Driving the rebel deep within his works.
                   &apos;Tis nightfall; not an enemy lurks
                       In sight. the chafing men

                   But night is treacherous, Grant is wary;
                   Of brave blood be a little chary.
                   Patience! the Fort is good as won;
                   To-morrow, and into Donelson.</hi>

                   The winter-fight for Donelson.
                                             Hurrah!
                   The spell of old defeat is broke,

                       They answered him aloud.
               And hand grasped hand, and glances met
               In happy triumph; eyes grew wet.
               O, to the punches brewed that night
               Went little water. Windows bright
               Beamed rosy on the sleet without,
               And from the deep street came the frequent shout;
               While some in prayer, as these in glee,
               Blessed heaven for the winter-victory.

                   In midnight beds, and early rose,
                   And, feverish in the foggy snows,
               Snatched the damp paper—wife and maid.
                   The death-list like a river flows
                       Down the pale sheet,
               And there the whelming waters meet.

                       Ah God! may Time with happy haste
                       Bring wail and triumph to a waste,
                           And war be done;
                       The battle flag-staff fall athwart
                       The curs&apos;d ravine, and wither; naught
                           Be left of trench or gun;
                       The bastion, let it ebb away,
                       Washed with the river bed; and Day
                           In vain seek Donelson.
