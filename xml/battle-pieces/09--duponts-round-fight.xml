"The plan of attack was simple and effective, being for the ships to steam in a circle, or ellipse, running close to one shore as they came down(italicize) teh rive, drifting or steaming as slowly as possible past the batteries there, and paying their fiery respects, then making the turn to go back, and as the when up(italics) the river, favoring the other batteries with a similar compliment."

As Stanton Garner writes, "The ships at Port Royal 'in an orbit sailed' as they fought for the right, the unity, and the law of the covenant of America with God" (124). </note>
