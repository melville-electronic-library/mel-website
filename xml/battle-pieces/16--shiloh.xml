Melville also referred to Hawthorne as "the literary Shiloh of America" in "Hawthorne and his Mosses" (NN <hi rend="italic">Piazza Tales</hi>, 181). See also "The Bell Tower": "A silence, as of the expectation of some Shiloh, pervaded the swarming plain" (NN <hi rend="italic">Piazza Tales</hi>, 252).</note>.</l>
