				<p>The incident on which this piece is based is narrated in a newspaper account of the battle to be found in the "Rebellion Record." During the disaster to the national forces on the first day, a brigade on the extreme left found itself isolated. The perils it encountered are given in detail. Among others, the following sentences occur:</p><p>"Under cover of the fire from the bluffs, the rebels rushed down, crossed the ford, and in a moment were seen forming this side the creek in open fields, and within close musket-range. Their color-bearers stepped defiantly to the front as the engagement opened furiously; the rebels pouring in sharp, quick volleys of musketry, and their batteries above continuing to support them with a destructive fire. Our sharpshooters wanted to pick off the audacious rebel color-bearers, but Colonel Stuart interposed: [']No, no, they're too brave fellows to be killed.[']"</p>

<l><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> color-bearers facing death</l>
<l>White in the whirling sulphurous wreath,</l>
<l rend="2em">Stand boldly out before the line</l>
<l>Right and left their glances go,</l>
<l n="5">Proud of each other, glorying in their show;</l>
<l>Their battle-flags about them blow,</l>
<l rend="2em">And fold them as in flame divine:</l>
<l>Such living robes are only seen</l>
<l>Round martyrs burning on the green—</l>
<l n="10">And martyrs for the Wrong have been.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Perish their Cause! but mark the men—</l>
<l>Mark the planted statues, then</l>
<l>Draw trigger on them if you can.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The leader of a patriot-band</l>
<l n="15">Even so could view rebels who so could stand;</l>
<l rend="2em"><pb facs="/images/battle-pieces-v1/battle-pieces-i-0153.jpg"/>And this when peril pressed him sore,</l>
<l>Left aidless in the shivered front of war—</l>
<l rend="2em">Skulkers behind, defiant foes before,</l>
<l>And fighting with a broken brand.</l>
<l n="20">The challenge in that courage rare—</l>
<l>Courage defenseless, proudly bare—</l>
<l>Never could tempt him; he could dare</l>
<l>Strike up the leveled rifle there.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Sunday at Shiloh, and the day</l>
<l n="25">When Stonewall charged—McClellan;s crimson May,</l>
<l>And Chickamauga&apos;s wave of death,</l>
<l>And of the Wilderness the cypress wreath—</l>
<l rend="4em">All these have passed away.</l>
<l>The life in the veins of Treason lags,</l>
<l n="30">Her daring color-bearers drop their flags,</l>
<l rend="2em">And yield. <hi rend="italic">Now</hi> shall we fire?</l>
<l rend="4em">Can poor spite be?</l>
<l rend="2em">Shall nobleness in victory less aspire</l>
<l rend="2em">Than in reverse? Spare Spleen her ire,</l>
<l n="35" rend="4em">And think how Grant met Lee</l>
