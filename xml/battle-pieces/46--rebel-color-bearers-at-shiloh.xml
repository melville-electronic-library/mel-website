A plea against the vindictive cry raised by civilians shortly
after the surrender at <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:489" type="place">Appomattox</name>

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The color-bearers facing death
White in the whirling sulphurous wreath,
  Stand boldly out before the line
Right and left their glances go,
Proud of each other, glorying in their show;
Their battle-flags about them blow,
  And fold them as in flame divine:
Such living robes are only seen
Round martyrs burning on the green—
And martyrs for the Wrong have been.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Perish their Cause! but mark the men—
Mark the planted statues, then
Draw trigger on them if you can.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The leader of a patriot-band
Even so could view rebels who so could stand;
  <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1438001558635-ek039ukm374rhpvi-66fa8bd2bdc6e48238ad45d0e595b6d5%2F155.jpg"/>And this when peril pressed him sore,
Left aidless in the shivered front of war—
  Skulkers behind, defiant foes before,
And fighting with a broken brand.
The challenge in that courage rare—
Courage defenseless, proudly bare—
Never could tempt him; he could dare
Strike up the leveled rifle there.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Sunday at Shiloh, and the day
When <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:137" type="person">Stonewall</name> charged—<name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:178" type="person">McClellan</name>&apos;s crimson May,
And <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:490" type="place">Chickamauga</name>&apos;s wave of death,
And of the <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:454" type="place">Wilderness</name> the cypress wreath—
    All these have passed away.
The life in the veins of Treason lags,
Her daring color-bearers drop their flags,
  And yield. Now shall we fire?
    Can poor spite be?
Shall nobleness in victory less aspire
Than in reverse? Spare Spleen her ire,
  And think how <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:149" type="person">Grant</name> met <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:139" type="person">Lee</name>.</p></div></body>
