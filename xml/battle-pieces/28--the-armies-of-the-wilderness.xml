<l><hi rend="smallcaps">Like</hi> snows the camps on southern hills</l>
<l rend="2em">Lay all the winter long,</l>
<l>Our levies there in patience stood—</l>
<l rend="2em">They stood in patience strong.</l>
<l>On fronting slopes gleamed other camps</l>
<l rend="2em">Where faith as firmly clung:</l>
<l>Ah, froward kin! so brave amiss—</l>
<l rend="2em">The zealots of the Wrong.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<hi rend="italic"><l rend="6em">In this strife of brothers</l>

<lg>
<l>Through the pointed glass our soldiers saw</l>
<l rend="2em">The base-ball bounding sent;</l>
<l><pb facs="/images/battle-pieces-v1/battle-pieces-i-0102.jpg"/>
They could have joined them in their sport</l>
<l rend="2em">But for the vale&apos;s deep rent.</l>
<l>And others turned the reddish soil,</l>
<l rend="2em">Like diggers of graves they bent:</l>
<l>The reddish soil nd trenching toil</l>
<l rend="4em">Begat presentiment.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<hi rend="italic"><l rend="6em">Did the Fathers feel mistrust?</l>
<l rend="8em">Can no final good be wrought?</l>
<l rend="6em">Over and over, again and again</l>
<l rend="8em">Must the fight for the Right be fought?</l></hi>
</lg>
<lb/>
<lg>
<l>They lead a Gray-back to the crag:</l>
<l rend="2em">&quot;Your earth-works yonder—tell us, man!&quot;</l>
<l>&quot;A prisoner—no deserter, I,</l>
<l rend="2em">Nor one of the tell-tale clan.&quot;</l>
<l>His rags they mark: &quot;True-blue like you</l>
<l rend="2em">Should wear the color—your Country&apos;s, man!&quot;</l>
<l>He grinds his teeth: &quot;However that be,</l>
<l rend="2em">Yon earth-works have their plan.&quot;</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<hi rend="italic"><l rend="6em">Such brave ones, foully snared</l>
<l rend="8em">By Belial&apos;s wily plea,</l>
<l rend="6em">Were faithful unto the evil end—</l>
<l rend="10em">Feudal fidelity.</l></hi>

&quot;Well, then, your camps—come, tell the names!&quot;</l>
<l rend="2em">Freely he leveled his finger then:</l>
<l>&quot;Yonder—see—are our Georgians; on the crest,</l>
<l rend="2em">The Carolinians; lower, past the glen,</l>
<l>Virginians—Alabamians—Mississippians—Kentuckians</l>
<l rend="2em">(Follow my finger)—Tennesseeans; and the ten</l>
<l>Camps <hi rend="italic">there</hi>—ask your grave-pits; they&apos;ll tell.</l>
<l rend="2em">Halloa! I see the picket-hut, the den</l>
<l>Where I last night lay.&quot; &quot;Where&apos;s Lee?&quot;</l>
<l rend="2em">&quot;In the hearts and bayonets of all yon men!&quot;</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<hi rend="italic"><l rend="6em">The tribes swarm up to war</l>
<l rend="8em">As in ages long ago,</l>
<l rend="6em">Ere the palm of promise leaved</l>
<l rend="8em">And the lily of Christ did blow.</l></hi>
</lg>
<lb/>
<lg>
<l>Their mounted pickets for miles are spied</l>
<l rend="2em">Dotting the lowland plain,</l>
<l>The nearer ones in their veteran-rags—</l>
<l rend="2em">Loutish they loll in lazy disdain.</l>
<l>But ours in perilous places bide</l>
<l rend="2em">With rifles ready and eyes that strain</l>
<l>Deep through the dim suspected wood</l>
<l rend="2em">Where the Rapidan rolls amain.</l>

<hi rend="italic"><l rend="6em"><pb facs="/images/battle-pieces-v1/battle-pieces-i-0104.jpg"/>
The Indian has passed away,</l>
<l rend="8em">But creeping comes another—</l>
<l rend="6em">Deadlier far. Picket,</l>
<l rend="8em">Take heed—take heed of thy brother!</l></hi>
</lg>
<lb/>
<lg>
<l>From a wood-hung height, an outpost lone,</l>
<l rend="2em">Crowned with a woodman&apos;s fort,</l>
<l>The sentinel looks on a land of dole,</l>
<l rend="4em">Like Paran, all amort.</l>
<l>Black chimneys, gigantic in moor-like wastes,</l>
<l rend="2em">The scowl of the clouded sky retort;</l>
<l>The hearth is a houseless stone again—</l>
<l rend="2em">Ah! where shall the people be sought?</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<hi rend="italic"><l rend="6em">Since the venom such blastment deals,</l>
<l rend="8em">The south should have paused, and thrice,</l>
<l rend="6em">Ere with heat of her hate she hatched</l>
<l rend="8em">The egg with the cockatrice.</l></hi>
</lg>
<lb/>
<lg>
<l>A path down the mountain winds to the glade</l>
<l rend="2em">Where the dead of the Moonlight Fight lie low;</l>
<l>A hand reaches out of the thin-laid mould</l>
<l rend="2em">As begging help which none can bestow.</l>
<l><pb facs="/images/battle-pieces-v1/battle-pieces-i-0105.jpg"/>
But the field-mouse small and busy ant</l>
<l rend="2em">Heap their hillocks, to hide if they may the woe:</l>
<l>By the bubbling spring lies the rusted canteen,</l>
<l rend="2em">And the drum which the drummer-boy dying let go.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<hi rend="italic"><l rend="6em">Dust to dust, and blood for blood—</l>
<l rend="8em">Passion and pangs! Has Time</l>
<l rend="6em">Gone back? or is this the Age</l>
<l rend="8em">Of the world&apos;s great Prime?</l></hi>
</lg>
<lb/>
<lg>
<l>The wagon mired and cannon dragged</l>
<l rend="2em">Have trenched their scar; the plain</l>
<l>Tramped like the cindery beach of the damned—</l>
<l rend="2em">A site for the city of <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:195" type="person">Cain</name>.</l>
<l>And stumps of forests for dreary leagues</l>
<l rend="2em">Like a massacre show. The armies have lain</l>
<l>By fires where gums and balms did burn,</l>
<l rend="2em">And the seeds of Summer&apos;s reign.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<hi rend="italic"><l rend="6em">Where are the birds and boys?</l>
<l rend="8em">Who shall go chestnutting when</l>
<l rend="6em">October returns? The nuts—</l>
<l rend="8em">O, long ere they grow again.</l></hi>

They snug their huts with the chapel-pews,</l>
<l rend="2em">In court-houses stable their steeds—</l>
<l>Kindle their fires with indentures and bonds,</l>
<l rend="2em">And old <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:196" type="person">Lord Fairfax</name>&apos;s parchment deeds;</l>
<l>And Virginian gentlemen&apos;s libraries old—</l>
<l rend="2em">Books which only the scholar heeds—</l>
<l>Are flung to his kennel. It is ravage and range,</l>
<l rend="2em">And gardens are left to weeds.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<hi rend="italic"><l rend="6em">Turned adrift into war</l>
<l rend="8em">Man runs wild on the plain,</l>

<l rend="2em">Aloft by the hill-side hamlet&apos;s graves,</l>
<l>On a head-stone used for a hearth-stone there</l>
<l rend="2em">The water is bubbling for punch for our braves.</l>
<l>What if the night be drear, and the blast</l>
<l rend="2em">Ghostly shrieks? their rollicking staves</l>
<l>Make frolic the heart; beating time with their swords,</l>
<l rend="2em">What care they if Winter raves?</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<hi rend="italic"><l rend="6em">Is life but a dream? and so,</l>
<l rend="8em">In the dream do men laugh aloud?</l>
<l rend="6em"><pb facs="/images/battle-pieces-v1/battle-pieces-i-0107.jpg"/>So strange seems mirth in a camp,</l>

<l rend="2em">And mounts our Signal Hill;</l>

<l rend="2em">Briefly he looks his fill,</l>
<l>Then drops his gray eye on the ground,</l>

For the scheme that was nursed by the <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:483" type="place">Culpepper</name> hearth
  With the slowly-smoked cigar—
The scheme that smouldered through winter long
  Now bursts into act—into waw—
The resolute scheme of a heart as calm
  As the Cyclone&apos;s core.

       <hi rend="italic"> The fight for the city is fought
          In Nature&apos;s old domain;
        Man goes out to the wilds,
          And <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:198" type="person">Orpheus</name>&apos; charm is vain.</hi>

In glades they meet skull after skull
  Where pine-cones lay—the rusted gun,
Green shoes full of bones, the mouldering coat
  And cuddled-up skeleton;
And scores of such. Some start as in dreams,
  And comrades lost bemoan:
By the edge of those wilds <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:137" type="person">Stonewall</name> had charged—
  But the Year and the Man were gone.

        <hi rend="italic">At the height of their madness
          The night winds pause,
        Recollecting themselves;
          But no lull in these wars.</hi>

<pb facs="/images/battle-pieces-v1/battle-pieces-i-0110.jpg"/>

A gleam!—a volley! And who shall go
  Storming the swarmers in jungles dread?
No cannon-ball answers, no proxies are sent—
  They rush in the shrapnel&apos;s stead.
Plume and sash are vanities now—
  Let them deck the pall of the dead;
They go where the shade is, perhaps into Hades,
  Where the brave of all times have led.

       <hi rend="italic"> There&apos;s a dust of hurrying feet,
          Bitten lips and bated breath,
        And drums that challenge to the grave,
          And faces fixed, forefeeling death.</hi>

What husky huzzahs in the hazy groves—
  What flying encounters fell;
Pursuer and pursued like ghosts disappear
  In gloomed shade—their end who shall tell?
The crippled, a ragged-barked stick for a crutch,
  Limp to some elfin dell—
Hobble from the sight of dead faces—white
  As pebbles in a well.

       <hi rend="italic"> Few burial rites shall be;
          No priest with book and band

<pb facs="/images/battle-pieces-v1/battle-pieces-i-0111.jpg"/>

				Shall come to the secret place
          Of the corpse in the foeman&apos;s land.</hi>

Watch and fast, march and fight—clutch your gun?
  Day-fights and night-fights; sore is the strees;
Look, through the pines what line comes on?
  <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:199" type="person">Longstreet</name> slants through the hauntedness?
&apos;Tis charge for charge, and shout for yell:
  Such battles on battles oppress—
But Heaven lent strength, the Right strove well,
  And emerged from the Wilderness.

       <hi rend="italic"> Emerged, for the way was won;
          But t<ref target="#ref_19186">he Pillar of Smoke</ref><note xml:id="ref_19186">Alluding to the the pilar of smoke followed by the Israelites through the Wilderness as described in the Book of Exodus.[reference, biblical]</note> that led
        Was brand-like with ghosts that went up
              Ashy and red.</hi>

None can narrate that strife in the pines,
  A seal is on it—<ref target="#ref_19191">Sabaean</ref><note xml:id="ref_19191">Ancient people of the Arabian Peninsula mention in the Old Testament books of Job, Joel, Ezekiel, and Isaiah.</note> lore!
Obscure as the wood, the entangled rhyme
  But hints at the maze of war—
Vivid glimpses or livid through peopled gloom,
  And fires which creep and char—
A riddle of death, of which the slain
    Sole solvers are.

<pb facs="/images/battle-pieces-v1/battle-pieces-i-0112.jpg"/>
        <hi rend="italic">Long they withhold the roll
          Of the shroudless dead. It is right;
        Not yet can we bear the flare
            Of the funeral light.</hi>
