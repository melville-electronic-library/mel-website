and
Aspects of the WarHerman Melville
1866
New York:
Harper &amp; Brothers, Publishers
Franklin Square<pb/></p><div><p> Entered, according to Act of Congress, in the year one thousand eight hundred
and sixty-six, by
HARPER &amp; BROTHERS,
In the Clerk&apos;s Office of the District Court of the Southern District of
New York.

</p><p>
</p></div><pb/><div><p>THE BATTLE-PIECES
IN THIS VOLUME ARE DEDICATED
TO THE MEMORY OF THE
THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND
WHO IN THE WAR
FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF THE UNION
FELL DEVOTEDLY
UNDER THE FLAG OF THEIR FATHERS.

</p><p>
</p></div><pb/><pb/><div><p>[ With few exceptions, the Pieces in this volume originated in an impulse
imparted by the fall of Richmond. They were composed without reference to
collective arrangement, but, being brought together in review, naturally fall into
the order assumed.

</p><p>The events and incidents of the conflict—making up a whole, in varied amp-
litude, corresponding with the geographical area covered by the war—from
these but a few themes have been taken, such as for any cause chanced to im-
print themselves upon the mind.

</p><p>The aspects which the strife as a memory assumes are as manifold as are the
moods of involuntary meditation—moods variable, and at times widely at vari-
ance. Yielding instinctively, one after another, to feelings not inspired from
any one source exclusively, and unmindful, without purposing to be, of consis-
tency, I seem, in most of these verses, to have but placed a harp in a window,
and noted the contrasted airs which wayward winds have played upon the
strings.]

  Storming the swarmers in jungles dread?
No cannon-ball answers, no proxies are sent—

Plume and sash are vanities now—

  Where the brave of all times have led.

  What flying encounters fell;
Pursuer and pursued like ghosts disappear
  In gloomed shade—their end who shall tell?

Hobble from the sight of dead faces—white
  As pebbles in a well.

But he shall warm—Warm with the solemn metal there,And all its ordered fury share,In attitude a gladiatorial form.The Admiral—yielding to the loveWhich held his life and ship so dear—Sailed second in the long fleet&apos;s midmost line;Yet thwarted all their care:He lashed himself aloft, and shoneStar of the fight, with influence sentThroughout the dusk embattlement;And so they neared the strait and walls of stone.No sprightly fife as in the field,The decks were hushed like fanes in prayer;Behind each man a holy angel stood—He stood, though none was &apos;ware.Out spake the forts on either hand,Back speak the ships when spoken to,<pb/>And set their flags in concert true,And On and in! is Farragut&apos;s command.But what delays? &apos;mid wounds aboveDim buoys give hint of death below—Sea-ambuscades, where evil art had apedHecla that hides in snow.The centre-van, entangled, trips;The starboard leader holds straight on:A cheer for the Tecumseh!—nay,Before their eyes the turreted ship goes down!The fire redoubles. While the fleetHangs dubious—ere the horror ran—The Admiral rushes to his rightful place—Well met! apt hour and man!—Closes with peril, takes the lead,His action is a stirring call;He strikes his great heart through them all,And is the genius of their daring deed.The forts are daunted, slack their fire,Confounded by the deadlier aim<pb/>And rapid broadsides of the speeding fleet,And fierce denouncing flame.Yet shots from four dark hulls embayedCome raking through the loyal crews,Whom now each dying mate enduesWith his last look, anguished yet undismayed.A flowering time to guilt is given,And traitors have their glorying hour;O late, but sure, the righteous Paramount comes—Palsy is on their power!So proved it with the rebel keels,The strong-holds past: assailed, they run;The Selma strikes, and the work is done:The dropping anchor the achievement seals.But no, she turns—the Tennessee!The solid Ram of iron and oak,Strong as Evil, and bold as Wrong, though lone—A pestilence in her smoke.The flag-ship is her singled mark,The wooden Hartford. Let her come;She challenges the planet of Doom,And naught shall save her—not her iron bark.<pb/>Slip anchor, all! and at her, all!Bear down with rushing beaks—and now!First the Monongahela struck—and reeled;The Lackawana&apos;s prowNext crashed—crashed, but not crashing; thenThe Admiral rammed, and rasping nighSloped in a broadside, which glanced by:The Monitors battered at her adamant den.The Chickasaw plunged beneath the sternAnd pounded there; a huge wrought orbFrom the Manhattan pierced one wall, but dropped;Others the seas absorb.Yet stormed on all sides, narrowed in,Hampered and cramped, the bad one fought—Spat ribald curses from the portWhose shutters, jammed, locked up this Man-of-Sin.No pause or stay. They made a dinLike hammers round a boiler forged;Now straining strength tangled itself with strength,Till Hate her will disgorged.The white flag showed, the fight was won—Mad shouts went up that shook the Bay;<pb/>But pale on the scarred fleet&apos;s decks there layA silent man for every silenced gun.And quiet far below the wave,Where never cheers shall move their sleep,Some who did boldly, nobly earn them, lie—Charmed children of the deep.But decks that now are in the seed,And cannon yet within the mine,Shall thrill the deeper, gun and pine,Because of the Tecumseh&apos;s glorious deed.

A plea against the vindictive cry raised by civilians shortly after the surrender at Appomattox.The color-bearers facing deathWhite in the whirling sulphurous wreath,Stand boldly out before the line;Right and left their glances go,Proud of each other, glorying in their show;Their battle-flags about them blow,And fold them as in flame divine:Such living robes are only seenRound martyrs burning on the green—And martyrs for the Wrong have been.Perish their Cause! but mark the men—Mark the planted statues, thenDraw trigger on them if you can.The leader of a patriot-bandEven so could view rebels who so could stand;<pb/>And this when peril pressed him sore,Left aidless in the shivered front of war—Skulkers behind, defiant foes before,And fighting with a broken brand.The challenge in that courage rare—Courage defenseless, proudly bare—Never could tempt him; he could dareStrike up the leveled rifle there.Sunday at Shiloh, and the dayWhen Stonewall charged—McClellan&apos;s crimson May,And Chickamauga&apos;s wave of death,And of the Wilderness the cypress wreath—All these have passed away.The life in the veins of Treason lags,Her daring color-bearers drop their flags,And yield.

No trophy this—a Stone unhewn,And stands where here the field immuresThe nameless brave whose palms are won.Outcast they sleep; yet fame is nigh—Pure fame of deeds, not doers;Nor deeds of men who bleeding dieIn cheer of hymns that round them float:In happy dreams such close the eye.But withering famine slowly wore,And slowly fell disease did gloat.Even Nature&apos;s self did aid deny;They choked in horror the pensive sigh.Yea, off from home sad Memory bore(Though anguished Yearning heaved that way),Lest wreck of reason might befall.As men in gales shun the lee shore,Though there the homestead be, and call,And thitherward winds and waters sway—As such lorn mariners, so fared they.<pb/>But naught shall now their peace molest.Their fame is this: they did endure—Endure, when fortitude was vainTo kindle any approving strainWhich they might hear. To these who rest,This healing sleep alone was sure.

).Much store they&apos;d heaped of captured armsAnd, peradventure, pilfered cheer;For Mosby&apos;s lads oft hearts enlargeIn revelry by some gorge&apos;s marge.<pb/>“Don&apos;t let your sabres rattle and ring;To his oat-bag let each man give heed—There now, that fellow&apos;s bag&apos;s untied,Sowing the road with the precious grain.Your carbines swing at hand—you need!Look to yourselves, and your nags beside,Men who after Mosby ride.”Picked lads and keen went sharp before—A guard, though scarce against surprise;And rearmost rode an answering troop,But flankers none to right or left.No bugle peals, no pennon flies:Silent they sweep, and fain would swoopOn Mosby with an Indian whoop.On, right on through the forest land,Nor man, nor maid, nor child was seen—Not even a dog. The air was still;The blackened hut they turned to see,And spied charred benches on the green;A squirrel sprang from the rotting millWhence Mosby sallied late, brave blood to spill.I<pb/>By worn-out fields they cantered on—Drear fields amid the woodlands wide;By cross-roads of some olden time,In which grew groves; by gate-stones down—Grassed ruins of secluded pride:A strange lone land, long past the prime,Fit land for Mosby or for crime.The brook in the dell they pass. One peersBetween the leaves: “Ay, there&apos;s the place—There, on the oozy ledge—&apos;twas thereWe found the body (Blake&apos;s, you know);Such whirlings, gurglings round the face—Shot drinking! Well, in war all&apos;s fair—So Mosby says. The bough—take care!”Hard by, a chapel. Flower-pot mouldDanked and decayed the shaded roof;The porch was punk; the clapboards spannedWith ruffled lichens gray or green;Red coral-moss was not aloof;And mid dry leaves green dead-man&apos;s-handGroped toward that chapel in Mosby-land.<pb/>They leave the road and take the wood,And mark the trace of ridges there—A wood where once had slept the farm—A wood where once tobacco grewDrowsily in the hazy air,And wrought in all kind things a calm—Such influence, Mosby! bids disarm.To ease even yet the place did woo—To ease which pines unstirring share,For ease the weary horses sighed:Halting, and slackening girths, they feed,Their pipes they light, they loiter there;Then up, and urging still the Guide,On, and after Mosby ride.This Guide in frowzy coat of brown,And beard of ancient growth and mould,Bestrode a bony steed and strong,As suited well with bulk he bore—A wheezy man with depth of holdWho jouncing went. A staff he swung—A wight whom Mosby&apos;s wasp had stung.<pb/>Burnt out and homeless—hunted long!That wheeze he caught in autumn-woodCrouching (a fat man) for his life,And spied his lean son &apos;mong the crewThat probed the covert. Ah! black bloodWas his &apos;gainst even child and wife—Fast friends to Mosby. Such the strife.A lad, unhorsed by sliding girths,Strains hard to readjust his seatEre the main body show the gap&apos;Twixt them and the rear-guard; scrub-oaks nearHe sidelong eyes, while hands move fleet;Then mounts and spurs. One drops his cap—“Let Mosby find!” nor heeds mishap.A gable time-stained peeps through trees:“You mind the fight in the haunted house?That&apos;s it; we clenched them in the room—An ambuscade of ghosts, we thought,But proved sly rebels on a bouse!Luke lies in the yard.” The chimneys loom:Some muse on Mosby—some on doom.<pb/>Less nimbly now through brakes they wind,And ford wild creeks where men have drowned;They skirt the pool, avoid the fen,And so till night, when down they lie,Their steeds still saddled, in wooded ground:Rein in hand they slumber then,Dreaming of Mosby&apos;s cedarn den.But Colonel and Major friendly satWhere boughs deformed low made a seat.The Young Man talked (all sworded and spurred)Of the partisan&apos;s blade he longed to win,And frays in which he meant to beat.The grizzled Major smoked, and heard:“But what&apos;s that—Mosby?” “No, a bird.”A contrast here like sire and son,Hope and Experience sage did meet;The Youth was brave, the Senior too;But through the Seven Days one had served,And gasped with the rear-guard in retreat:So he smoked and smoked, and the wreath he
blew—“Any sure news of Mesby&apos;s crew?”<pb/>He smoked and smoked, eying the whileA huge tree hydra-like in growth—Moon-tinged—with crook&apos;d boughs rent or lopped—Itself a haggard forest. “Come!”The Colonel cried, “to talk you&apos;re loath;D&apos;ye hear? I say he must be stopped,This Mosby—caged, and hair close cropped.”“Of course; but what&apos;s that dangling there?”“Where?” “From the tree—that gallows-bough;”“A bit of frayed bark, is it not?”“Ay—or a rope; did we hang last?—Don&apos;t like my neckerchief any how;”He loosened it: “O ay, we&apos;ll stopThis Mosby—but that vile jerk and drop!

By peep of light they feed and ride,Gaining a grove&apos;s green edge at morn,And mark the Aldie hills uprearAnd five gigantic horsemen carvedClear-cut against the sky withdrawn;Are more behind? an open snare?Or Mosby&apos;s men but watchmen there?<pb/>The ravaged land was miles behind,And Loudon spread her landscape rare;Orchards in pleasant lowlands stood,Cows were feeding, a cock loud crew,But not a friend at need was there;The valley-folk were only goodTo Mosby and his wandering brood.What best to do? what mean yon men?Colonel and Guide their minds compare;Be sure some looked their Leader through;Dismounted, on his sword he leanedAs one who feigns an easy air;And yet perplexed he was they knew—Perplexed by Mosby&apos;s mountain-crew.The Major hemmed as he would speak,But checked himself, and left the ringOf cavalrymen about their Chief—Young courtiers mute who paid their courtBy looking with confidence on their king;They knew him brave, foresaw no grief—But Mosby—the time to think is brief.<pb/>The Surgeon (sashed in sacred green)Was glad &apos;twas not for him to sayWhat next should be; if a trooper bleeds,Why he will do his best, as wont,And his partner in black will aid and pray;But judgment bides with him who leads,And Mosby many a problem breeds.This Surgeon was the kindliest manThat ever a callous trade professed;He felt for him, that Leader young,And offered medicine from his flask:The Colonel took it with marvelous zest.For such fine medicine good and strong,Oft Mosby and his foresters long.A charm of proof. “Ho, Major, come—Pounce on yon men! Take half your troop,Through the thickets wind—pray speedy be—And gain their rear. And, Captain Morn,Picket these roads—all travelers stop;The rest to the edge of this crest with me,That Mosby and his scouts may see.”<pb/>Commanded and done. Ere the sun stood steep,Back came the Blues, with a troop of Grays,Ten riding double—luckless ten!—Five horses gone, and looped hats lost,And love-locks dancing in a maze—Certes, but sophomores from the glenOf Mosby—not his veteran men.“Colonel,” said the Major, touching his cap,“We&apos;ve had our ride, and here they are.”“Well done! how many found you there?”“As many as I bring you here.”“And no one hurt?” “There&apos;ll be no scar—One fool was battered.” “Find their lair?”“Why, Mosby&apos;s brood camp every where.”He sighed, and slid clown from his horse,And limping went to a spring-head nigh.“Why, bless me, Major, not hurt, I hope?”“Battered my knee against a barWhen the rush was made; all right by-and-by.—Halloa! they gave you too much rope—Go back to Mosby, eh? elope?”I2<pb/>Just by the low-hanging skirt of woodThe guard, remiss, had given a chanceFor a sudden sally into the cover—But foiled the intent, nor fired a shot,Though the issue was a deadly trance;For, hurled &apos;gainst an oak that humped low over,Mosby&apos;s man fell, pale as a lover.They pulled some grass his head to ease(Lined with blue shreds a ground-nest stirred).The Surgeon came—“Here&apos;s a to-do!”“Ah!” cried the Major, darting a glance,“This fellow&apos;s the one that fired and spurredDown hill, but met reserves below—My boys, not Mosby&apos;s—so we go!”The Surgeon—bluff, red, goodly man—Kneeled by the hurt one; like a beeHe toiled. The pale young Chaplain too—(Who went to the wars for cure of souls,And his own student-ailments)—heBent over likewise; spite the two,Mosby&apos;s poor man more pallid grew.<pb/>Meanwhile the mounted captives nearJested; and yet they anxious showed;Virginians; some of family-pride,And young, and full of fire, and fineIn open feature and cheek that glowed;And here thralled vagabonds now they ride—But list! one speaks for Mosby&apos;s side.“Why, three to one—your horses strong—Revolvers, rifles, and a surprise—Surrender we account no shame!We live, are gay, and life is hope;We&apos;ll fight again when fight is wise.There are plenty more from where we came;But go find Mosby—start the game!”Yet one there was who looked but glum;In middle-age, a father he,And this his first experience too:“They shot at my heart when my hands were up—This fighting&apos;s crazy work, I see!”But noon is high; what next to do?The woods are mute, and Mosby is the foe.<pb/>“Save what we&apos;ve got,” the Major said;“Bad plan to make a scout too long;The tide may turn, and drag them back,And more beside. These rides I&apos;ve been,And every time a mine was sprang.To rescue, mind, they won&apos;t be slack—Look out for Mosby&apos;s rifle-crack.”“We&apos;ll welcome it! give crack for crack!Peril, old lad, is what I seek.”“O then, there&apos;s plenty to be had—By all means on, and have our fill!”With that, grotesque, he writhed his neck,Showing a scar by buck-shot made—Kind Mosby&apos;s Christmas gift, he said.“But, Colonel, my prisoners—let a guardMake sure of them, and lead to camp.That done, we&apos;re free for a dark-room fightIf so you say.” The other laughed“Trust me, Major, nor throw a damp.But first to try a little sleight—Sure news of Mosby would suit me quite.”<pb/>Herewith he turned—“Reb, have a dram?”Holding the Surgeon&apos;s flask with a smileTo a young scapegrace from the glen.“O yes!” he eagerly replied,“And thank you, Colonel, but—any guile?For if you think we&apos;ll blab—why, thenYou don&apos;t know Mosby or his men.”The Leader&apos;s genial air relaxed.“Best give it up,” a whisperer said.“By heaven, I&apos;ll range their rebel den!”“They&apos;ll treat you well,” the captive cried;“They&apos;re all like us—handsome—well bred:In wood or town, with sword or pen,Polite is Mosby, bland his men.”“Where were you, lads, last night?—come, tell!”“We?—at a wedding in the Vale—The bridegroom our comrade; by his sideBelisent, my cousin—O, so proudOf her young love with old wounds pale—A Virginian girl! God bless her pride—Of a crippled Mosby-man the bride!”<pb/>“Four walls shall mend that saucy mood,And moping prisons tame him down,”Said Captain Cloud. “God help that day,”Cried Captain Morn, “and he so young.But hark, he sings—a madcap one!”“O we multiply merrily in the May,The birds and Mosby&apos;s men, they say!”While echoes ran, a wagon old,Under stout guard of Corporal ChewCame up; a lame horse, dingy white,With clouted harness; ropes in hand,Cringed the humped driver, black in hue;By him (for Mosby&apos;s band a sight)A sister-rebel sat, her veil held tight.“I picked them up,” the Corporal said,“Crunching their way over stick and root,Through yonder wood. The man here—Cuff—Says they are going to Leesburg town.”The Colonel&apos;s eye took in the group;The veiled one&apos;s hand he spied—enough!Not Mosby&apos;s. Spite the gown&apos;s poor stuff,<pb/>Off went his hat: “Lady, fear not;We soldiers do what we deplore—I must detain you till we march.”The stranger nodded. Nettled now,He grew politer than before:—“Tis Mosby&apos;s fault, this halt and search:”The lady stiffened in her starch.“My duty, madam, bids me nowAsk what may seem a little rude.Pardon—that veil—withdraw it, please(Corporal! make every man fall back);Pray, now, I do but what I should;Bethink you, &apos;tis in masks like theseThat Mosby haunts the villages.”Slowly the stranger drew her veil,And looked the Soldier in the eye—A glance of mingled foul and fair;Sad patience in a proud disdain,And more than quietude. A sighShe heaved, as if all unaware,And far seemed Mosby from her care.<pb/>She came from Yewton Place, her home,So ravaged by the war&apos;s wild play—Campings, and foragings, and fires—That now she sought an aunt&apos;s abode.Her kinsmen? In Lee&apos;s army, they.The black? A servant, late her sire&apos;s.And Mosby? Vainly he inquires.He gazed, and sad she met his eye;“In the wood yonder were you lost?”No; at the forks they left the roadBecause of hoof-prints (thick they were—Thick as the words in notes thrice crossed),And fearful, made that episode.In fear of Mosby? None she showed.Her poor attire again he scanned:“Lady, once more; I grieve to jarOn all sweet usage, but must pleadTo have what peeps there from your dress;That letter—&apos;tis justly prize of war.”She started—gave it—she must need.“Tis not from Mosby? May I read?”<pb/>And straight such matter he perusedThat with the Guide he went apart.The Hospital Steward&apos;s turn began:“Must squeeze this darkey; every tapOf knowledge we are bound to start.”“Garry,” she said, “tell all you canOf Colonel Mosby—that brave man.”“Dun know much, sare; and missis hereKnow less dan me. But dis I know—”“Well, what?” “I dun know what I know.”“A knowing answer!” The hump-back coughed,Rubbing his yellowish wool like tow.“Come—Mosby—tell!” “O dun look so!My gal nursed missis—let we go.”“Go where?” demanded Captain Cloud;“Back into bondage? Man, you&apos;re free!”“Well, let we free!” The Captain&apos;s browLowered; the Colonel came—had heard:“Pooh! pooh! his simple heart I see—A faithful servant.—Lady” (a bow),“Mosby&apos;s abroad—with us you&apos;ll go.<pb/>“Guard! look to your prisoners; back to camp!The man in the grass—can he mount and away?Why, how he groans!” “Bad inward bruise—Might lug him along in the ambulance.”“Coals to Newcastle! let him stay.Boots and saddles!—our pains we lose,Nor care I if Mosby hear the news!”But word was sent to a house at hand,And a flask was left by the hurt one&apos;s side.They seized in that same house a man,Neutral by clay, by night a foe—So charged his neighbor late, the Guide.A grudge? Hate will do what it can;Along he went for a Mosby-man.No secrets now; the bugle calls;The open road they take, nor shunThe hill; retrace the weary way.But one there was who whispered low,“This is a feint—we&apos;ll back anon;Young Hair-Brains don&apos;t retreat, they say;A brush with Mosby is the play!”<pb/>They rode till eve. Then on a farmThat lay along a hill-side green,Bivouacked. Fires were made, and thenCoffee was boiled; a cow was coaxedAnd killed, and savory roasts were seen;And under the lee of a cattle-penThe guard supped freely with Mosby&apos;s men.The ball was bandied to and fro;Hits were given and hits were met:“Chickamauga, Feds—take off your hat!”“But the Fight in the Clouds repaid you, Rebs!”“Forgotten about Manassas yet?”Chatting and chaffing, and tit for tat,Mosby&apos;s clan with the troopers sat.“Here comes the moon!” a captive cried;“A song! what say? Archy, my lad!”Hailing the still one of the clan(A boyish face with girlish hair),“Give us that thing poor Pansy madeLast year.” He brightened, and began;And this was the song of Mosby&apos;s man:<pb/>Spring is come; she shows her pass—Wild violets cool!South of woods a small close grass—A vernal wool!Leaves are a&apos;bud on the sassafras—They&apos;ll soon be full:Blessings on the friendly screen—I&apos;m for the South! says the leafage green.Robins! fly, and take your fillOf out-of-doors—Garden, orchard, meadow, hill,Barns and bowers;Take your fill, and have your will—Virginia&apos;s yours!But, bluebirds! keep away, and fearThe ambuscade in bushes here.“A green song that,” a sergeant said;“But where&apos;s poor Pansy? gone, I fear.”“Ay, mustered out at Ashby&apos;s Gap.”“I see; now for a live man&apos;s song;Ditty for ditty—prepare to cheer.My bluebirds, you can fling a cap!You barehead Mosby-boys—why—clap!”<pb/>Nine Blue-coats went a-nuttingSlyly in Tennessee—Not for chestnuts—better than that—Hush, you bumble-bee!Nutting, nutting—All through the year there&apos;s nutting!A tree they spied so yellow,Rustling in motion queer;In they fired, and down they dropped—Butternuts, my dear!Nutting, nutting—Who&apos;ll &apos;list to go a-nutting?Ah! why should good fellows foemen be?And who would dream that foes they were—Larking and singing so friendly then—A family likeness in every face.But Captain Cloud made sour demur:“Guard! keep your prisoners in the pen,And let none talk with Mosby&apos;s men.”<pb/>That captain was a valorous one(No irony, but honest truth),Yet down from his brain cold drops distilled,Making stalactites in his heart—A conscientious soul, forsooth;And with a formal hate was filledOf Mosby&apos;s band; and some he&apos;d killed.Meantime the lady rueful sat,Watching the flicker of a fireWhere the Colonel played the outdoor hostIn brave old hall of ancient Night.But ever the. dame grew shyer and shyer,Seeming with private grief engrossed—Grief far from Mosby, housed or lost.The ruddy embers showed her pale.The Soldier did his best devoir:“Some coffee?—no?—a cracker?—one?”Cared for her servant—sought to cheer:“I know, I know—a cruel war!But wait—even Mosby &apos;ll eat his bun;The Old Hearth—back to it anon!”<pb/>But cordial words no balm could bring;She sighed, and kept her inward chafe,And seemed to hate the voice of glee—Joyless and tearless. Soon he calledAn escort: “See this lady safeIn yonder house.—Madam, you&apos;re free.And now for Mosby.—Guide! with me.”(“A night-ride, eh?”) “Tighten your girths!But, buglers! not a note from you.Fling more rails on the fires—a blaze!”(“Sergeant, a feint—I told you so—Toward Aldie again. Bivouac, adieu!”)After the cheery flames they gaze,Then back for Mosby through the maze.The moon looked through the trees, and tippedThe scabbards with her elfin beam;The Leader backward cast his glance,Proud of the cavalcade that came—A hundred horses, bay and cream:“Major! look how the lads advance—Mosby we&apos;ll have in the ambulance!”<pb/>“No doubt, no doubt:—was that a hare?—First catch, then cook; and cook him brown.”“Trust me to catch,” the other cried—“The lady&apos;s letter!—a dance, man, danceThis night is given in Leesburg town!”“He&apos;ll be there too!” wheezed out the Guide;“That Mosby loves a dance and ride!”“The lady, ah!—the lady&apos;s letter—A lady, then, is in the case,”Muttered the Major. “Ay, her auntWrites her to come by Friday eve(To-night), for people of the place,At Mosby&apos;s last fight jubilant,A party give, though table-cheer be scant.”The Major hemmed. “Then this night-rideWe owe to her?—One lighted houseIn a town else dark.—The moths, begar!Are not quite yet all dead!” “How? how?”“A mute, meek, mournful little mouse!—Mosby has wiles which subtle are—But woman&apos;s wiles in wiles of war!”<pb/>“Tut, Major! by what craft or guile—”“Can&apos;t tell! but he&apos;ll be found in wait.Softly we enter, say, the town—Good! pickets post, and all so sure—When—crack! the rifles from every gate,The Gray-backs fire—dash up and down—Each alley unto Mosby known!”“Now, Major, now—you take dark viewsOf a moonlight night.” “Well, well, we&apos;ll see,”And smoked as if each whiff were gain.The other mused; then sudden asked,“What would you do in grand decree?”“I&apos;d beat, if I could, Lee&apos;s armies—thenSend constables after Mosby&apos;s men.”“Ay! ay!—you&apos;re odd.” The moon sailed up;On through the shadowy land they went.“Names must be made and printed be!”Hummed the blithe Colonel. “Doc, your flask!Major, I drink to your good content.My pipe is out—enough for me!One&apos;s buttons shine—does Mosby see?K<pb/>“But what comes here?” A man from the frontReported a tree athwart the road.“Go round it, then; no time to bide;All right—go on! Were one to stayFor each distrust of a nervous mood,Long miles we&apos;d make in this our rideThrough Mosby-land.—On! with the Guide!”Then sportful to the Surgeon turned:“Green sashes hardly serve by night!”“Nor bullets nor bottles,” the Major sighed,“Against these moccasin-snakes—such foesAs seldom come to solid fight:They kill and vanish; through grass they glide;Devil take Mosby!”—his horse here shied.“Hold! look—the tree, like a dragged balloon;A globe of leaves—some trickery here;My nag is right—best now be shy.”A movement was made, a hubbub and snarl;Little was plain—they blindly steer.The Pleiads, as from ambush sly,Peep out—Mosby&apos;s men in the sky!<pb/>As restive they turn, how sore they feel,And cross, and sleepy, and full of spleen,And curse the war. “Fools, North and South!”Said one right out. “O for a bed!O now to drop in this woodland green!”He drops as the syllables leave his mouth—Mosby speaks from the undergrowth—Speaks in a volley! out jets the flame!Men fall from their saddles like plums from trees;Horses take fright, reins tangle and bind;“Steady—dismount—form—and into the wood!”They go, but find what scarce can please:Their steeds have been tied in the field behindAnd Mosby&apos;s men are off like the wind.Sound the recall! vain to pursue—The enemy scatters in wilds he knows,To reunite in his own good time;And, to follow, they need divide—To come lone and lost on crouching foes:Maple and hemlock, beech and lime,Are Mosby&apos;s confederates, share the crime.<pb/>“Major,” burst in a bugler small,“The fellow we left in Loudon grass—Sir Slyboots with the inward bruise,His voice I heard—the very same—Some watchword in the ambush pass;Ay, sir, we had him in his shoes—We caught him—Mosby—but to lose!”“Go, go!—these saddle-dreamers! Well,And here&apos;s another.—Cool, sir, cool!”“Major, I saw them mount and sweep,And one was humped, or I mistake,And in the skurry dropped his wool.”“A wig! go fetch it:—the lads need sleep;They&apos;ll next see Mosby in a sheep!“Come, come, fall back! reform your ranks—All&apos;s jackstraws here! Where&apos;s Captain Morn?—We&apos;ve parted like boats in a raging tide!But stay—the Colonel—did he charge?And comes he there? &apos;Tis streak of dawn;Mosby is off, the woods are wide—Hist! there&apos;s a groan—this crazy ride!”<pb/>As they searched for the fallen, the dawn grew chill;They lay in the dew: “Ah! hurt much, Mink?And—yes—the Colonel!” Dead! but so calmThat death seemed nothing—even death,The thing we deem every tiling heart can think;Amid wilding roses that shed their balm,Careless of Mosby he lay—in a charm!The Major took him by the hand—Into the friendly clasp it bled(A ball through heart and hand he rued):“Good-by!” and gazed with humid glance;Then in a hollow revery said,“The weakest thing is lustihood;But Mosby”—and he checked his mood.“Where&apos;s the advance?—cut off, by heaven!Come, Surgeon, how with your wounded there?”“The ambulance will carry all.”“Well, get them in; we go to camp.Seven prisoners gone? for the rest have care.”Then to himself, “This grief is gall;That Mosby!—I&apos;ll cast a silver ball!”<pb/>“Ho!” turning—” Captain Cloud, you mindThe place where the escort went—so shady?Go, search every closet low and high,And barn, and bin, and hidden bower—Every covert—find that lady!And yet I may misjudge her—ay,Women (like Mosby) mystify.“We&apos;ll see. Ay, Captain, go—with speed!Surround and search; each living thingSecure; that done, await us whereWe last turned off. Stay! fire the cageIf the birds be flown.” By the cross-road springThe bands rejoined; no words; the glareTold all. Had Mosby plotted there?The weary troop that wended now—Hardly it seemed the same that prickedForth to the forest from the camp:Foot-sore horses, jaded men;Every backbone felt as nicked,Each eye dim as a sick-room lamp,All faces stamped with Mosby&apos;s stamp.<pb/>In order due the Major rode—Chaplain and Surgeon on either hand;A riderless horse a negro led;In a wagon the blanketed sleeper went;Then the ambulance with the bleeding band;And, an emptied oat-bag on each head,Went Mosby&apos;s men, and marked the dead.What gloomed them? what so cast them down,And changed the cheer that late they took,As double-guarded now they rodeBetween the files of moody men?Some sudden consciousness they brook,Or dread the sequel. That night&apos;s bloodDisturbed even Mosby&apos;s brotherhood.The flagging horses stumbled at roots,Floundered in mires, or clinked the stones;No rider spake except aside;But the wounded cramped in the ambulance,It was horror to hear their groans—Jerked along in the woodland ride,While Mosby&apos;s clan their revery hide.<pb/>The Hospital Steward—even he—Who on the sleeper kept his glance,Was changed; late bright-black beard and eyeLooked now hearse-black; his heavy heart,Like his fagged mare, no more could dance;His grape was now a raisin dry:&apos;Tis Mosby&apos;s homily—Man must die.The amber sunset flushed the campAs on the hill their eyes they fed;The pickets dumb looks at the wagon dart;A handkerchief waves from the bannered tent—As white, alas! the face of the dead:Who shall the withering news impart?The bullet of Mosby goes through heart to heart!They buried him where the lone ones lie(Lone sentries shot on midnight post)—A green-wood grave-yard hid from ken,Where sweet-fern flings an odor nigh—Yet held in fear for the gleaming ghost!Though the bride should see threescore and ten,She will dream of Mosby and his men.<pb/>Now halt the verse, and turn aside—The cypress falls athwart the way;No joy remains for bard to sing;And heaviest dole of all is this,That other hearts shall be as gayAs hers that now no more shall spring:To Mosby-land the dirges cling.K2

They await me nowWho wrought this stinging overthrow;They wait me; not as on the dayOf Pope&apos;s impelled retreat in disarray—By me impelled—when toward yon DomeThe clouds of war came rolling home.”The burst, the bitterness was spent,The heart-burst bitterly turbulent,And on he fared.<pb/>In nearness nowHe marks the Capitol—a showLifted in amplitude, and setWith standards flushed with the glow of Richmond yet;Trees and green terraces sleep below.Through the clear air, in sunny light,The marble dazes—a temple white.Intrepid soldier! had his blade been drawnFor yon starred flag, never as nowBid to the Senate-house had he gone,But freely, and in pageant borne,As when brave numbers without number, massed,Plumed the broad way, and pouring passed—Bannered, beflowered—between the shoresOf faces, and the dinn&apos;d huzzas,And balconies kindling at the sabre-flash,&apos;Mid roar of drums and guns, and cymbal-crash,While Grant and Sherman shone in blue—Close of the war and victory&apos;s long review.Yet pride at hand still aidful swelled,And up the hard ascent he held.The meeting follows. In his mienThe victor and the vanquished both are seen—All that he is, and what he late had been.<pb/>Awhile, with curious eyes they scanThe Chief who led invasion&apos;s van—Allied by family to one,Founder of the Arch the Invader warred upon:Who looks at Lee must think of Washington;In pain must think, and hide the thought,So deep with grievous meaning it is fraughtSecession in her soldier showsSilent and patient; and they feel(Developed even in just success)Dim inklings of a hazy future steal;Their thoughts their questions well express:“Does the sad South still cherish hate?Freely will Southern men with Northern mate?The blacks—should we our arm withdraw,Would that betray them? some distrust your law.And how if foreign fleets should come—Would the South then drive her wedges home?”And more hereof. The Virginian sees—Replies to such anxieties.Discreet his answers run—appearBriefly straightforward, coldly clear.“If now,” the Senators, closing, say,“Aught else remain, speak out, we pray.”<pb/>Hereat he paused; his better heartStrove strongly then; prompted a worthier partThan coldly to endure his doom.Speak out? Ay, speak, and for the brave,Who else no voice or proxy have;Frankly their spokesman here become,And the flushed North from her own victory save.That inspiration overrode—Hardly it quelled the galling loadOf personal ill. The inner feudHe, self-contained, a while withstood;They waiting. In his troubled eyeShadows from clouds unseen they spy;They could not mark within his breastThe pang which pleading thought oppressed:He spoke, nor felt the bitterness die.“My word is given—it ties my sword;Even were banners still abroad,Never could I strive in arms againWhile you, as fit, that pledge retain.Our cause I followed, stood in field and gate—All&apos;s over now, and now I follow Fate.But this is naught. A People call—A desolated land, and all<pb/>The brood of ills that press so sore,The natural offspring of this civil war,Which ending not in fame, such as might rearFitly its sculptured trophy here,Yields harvest large of doubt and dreadTo all who have the heart and headTo feel and know. How shall I speak?Thoughts knot with thoughts, and utterance check.Before my eyes there swims a haze,Through mists departed comrades gaze—First to encourage, last that shall upbraid!How shall I speak? The South would fainFeel peace, have quiet law again—Replant the trees for homestead-shade.You ask if she recants: she yields.Nay, and would more; would blend anew,As the bones of the slain in her forests do,Bewailed alike by us and you.A voice comes out from these charnel-fields,A plaintive yet unheeded one:‘Died all in vain? both sides undone?’Push not your triumph; do not urgeSubmissiveness beyond the verge.Intestine rancor would you bide,Nursing eleven sliding daggers in your side?<pb/>Far from my thought to school or threat;I speak the things which hard besetWhere various hazards meet the eyes,To elect in magnanimity is wise.Reap victory&apos;s fruit while sound the core;What sounder fruit than re-established law?I know your partial thoughts do pressSolely on us for war&apos;s unhappy stress;But weigh—consider—look at all,And broad anathema you&apos;ll recall.The censor&apos;s charge I&apos;ll not repeat,That meddlers kindled the war&apos;s white heat—Vain intermeddlers and malign,Both of the palm and of the pine;I waive the thought—which never can be rife—Common&apos;s the crime in every civil strife:But this I feel, that North and South were drivenBy Fate to arms. For our unshriven,What thousands, truest souls, were tried—As never may any be again—All those who stemmed Secession&apos;s pride,But at last were swept by the urgent tideInto the chasm. I know their pain.A story here may be applied:‘In Moorish lands there lived a maidBrought to confess by vow the creed<pb/>Of Christians. Fain would priests persuadeThat now she must approve by deedThe faith she kept. “What deed?” she asked.“Your old sire leave, nor deem it sin,And come with us.” Still more they taskedThe sad one: “If heaven you&apos;d win—Far from the burning pit withdraw,Then must you learn to hate your kin,Yea, side against them—such the law,For Moor and Christian are at war.”“Then will I never quit my sire,But here with him through every trial go,Nor leave him though in flames below—God help me in his fire!’”So in the South; vain every plea&apos;Gainst Nature&apos;s strong fidelity;True to the home and to the heart,Throngs cast their lot with kith and kin,Foreboding, cleaved to the natural part—Was this the unforgivable sin?These noble spirits are yet yours to win.Shall the great North go Sylla&apos;s way?Proscribe? prolong the evil day?Confirm the curse? infix the hate?In Union&apos;s name forever alienate?<pb/>From reason who can urge the plea—Freemen conquerors of the free?When blood returns to the shrunken vein,Shall the wound of the Nation bleed again?Well may the wars wan thought supply,And kill the kindling of the hopeful eye,Unless you do what even kings have doneIn leniency—unless you shunTo copy Europe in her worst estate—Avoid the tyranny you reprobate.”He ceased. His earnestness unforeseenMoved, but not swayed their former mien;And they dismissed him. Forth he wentThrough vaulted walks in lengthened lineLike porches erst upon the Palatine:Historic reveries their lesson lent,The Past her shadow through the Future sent.But no. Brave though the Soldier, grave his plea—Catching the light in the future&apos;s skies,Instinct disowns each darkening prophecy:Faith in America never dies;Heaven shall the end ordained fulfill,We march with Providence cheery still.

book, it would close with the notes. But the times are
such that patriotism—not free from solicitude—urges a
-
claim overriding all literary scruples.

</p><p>It is more than a year since the memorable surren-
der, but events have not yet rounded themselves into
completion. Not justly can we complain of this. There
has been an upheaval affecting the basis of things; to
altered circumstances complicated adaptations are to be
made; there are difficulties great and novel. But is
Reason still waiting for Passion to spend itself? We
have sung of the soldiers and sailors, but who shall
hymn the politicians?

</p><p>In view of the infinite desirableness of Re-establish-
ment, and considering that, so far as feeling is con-
cerned, it depends not mainly on the temper in which
the South regards the North, but rather conversely; one
who never was a blind adherent feels constrained to sub-
mit some thoughts, counting on the indulgence of his
countrymen.

</p><p>And, first, it may be said that, if among the feelings
and opinions growing immediately out of a great civil
<pb/>convulsion, there are any which time shall modify or
do away, they are presumably those of a less temperate
and charitable cast.

</p><p>There seems no reason why patriotism and narrow-
ness should go together, or why intellectual impartiality
should be confounded with political trimming, or why
serviceable truth should keep cloistered because not par-
tisan. Yet the work of Reconstruction, if admitted to
be feasible at all, demands little but common sense and
Christian charity. Little but these? These are much.

</p><p>Some of us are concerned because as yet the South
shows no penitence. But what exactly do we mean
by this? Since down to the close of the war she nev-
er confessed any for braving it, the only penitence now
left her is that which springs solely from the sense
of discomfiture; and since this evidently would be a
contrition hypocritical, it would be unworthy in us to
demand it. Certain it is that penitence, in the sense
of voluntary humiliation, will never be displayed. Nor
does this afford just ground for unreserved condemna-
tion. It is enough, for all practical purposes, if the
South have been taught by the terrors of civil war to
feel that Secession, like Slavery, is against Destiny; that
both now lie buried in one grave; that her fate is linked
with ours; and that together we comprise the Nation.

</p><p>The clouds of heroes who battled for the Union it is
<pb/>needless to eulogize here. But how of the soldiers on
the other side? And when of a free community we
name the soldiers, we thereby name the people. It was
in subserviency to the slave-interest that Secession was
plotted; but it was under the plea, plausibly urged, that
certain inestimable rights guaranteed by the Constitution
were directly menaced, that the people of the South
were cajoled into revolution. Through the arts of the
conspirators and the perversity of fortune, the most sens-
itive love of liberty was entrapped into the support of
a war whose implied end was the erecting in our ad-
vanced century of an Anglo-American empire based
upon the systematic degradation of man.

</p><p>Spite this clinging reproach, however, signal military
virtues and achievements have conferred upon the Con-
federate arms historic fame, and upon certain of the
commanders a renown extending beyond the sea—a re-
nown which we of the North could not suppress, even
if we would. In personal character, also, not a few of
the military leaders of the South enforce forbearance;
the memory of others the North refrains from dispar-
aging; and some, with more or less of reluctance, she
can respect. Posterity, sympathizing with our convic-
tions, but removed from our passions, may perhaps go
farther here. If George IV. could, out of the graceful
instinct of a gentleman, raise an honorable monument in
<pb/>the great fane of Christendom over the remains of the
enemy of his dynasty, Charles Edward, the invader of
England and victor in the rout at Preston Pans—upon
whose head the king&apos;s ancestor but one reign removed
had set a price—is it probable that the grandchildren
of General Grant will pursue with rancor, or slur by
sour neglect, the memory of Stonewall Jackson?

</p><p>But the South herself is not wanting in recent his-
tories and biographies which record the deeds of her
chieftains—writings freely published at the North by
loyal houses, widely read here, and with a deep though
saddened interest. By students of the war such works
are hailed as welcome accessories, and tending to the
completeness of the record.

</p><p>Supposing a happy issue out of present perplexities,
then, in the generation next to come, Southerners there
will be yielding allegiance to the Union, feeling all
their interests bound up in it, and yet cherishing un-
ebuked that kind of feeling for the memory of the sol-
diers of the fallen Confederacy that Burns, Scott, and
the Ettrick Shepherd felt for the memory of the gallant
clansmen ruined through their fidelity to the Stuarts—
feeling whose passion was tempered by the poetry
imbuing it, and which in no wise affected their loyalty
to the Georges, and which, it may be added, indirectly
contributed excellent things to literature. But, setting
<pb/>this view aside, dishonorable would it be in the South
were she willing to abandon to shame the memory of
brave men who with signal personal disinterestedness
warred in her behalf, though from motives, as we be
ieve, so deplorably astray.

</p><p>Patriotism is not baseness, neither is it inhumanity.
The mourners who this summer bear flowers to the
mounds of the Virginian and Georgian dead are, in
their domestic bereavement and proud affection, as sa
red in the eye of Heaven as are those who go with
similar offerings of tender grief and love into the cem-
eteries of our Northern martyrs. And yet, in one as-
pect, how needless to point the contrast.

</p><p>Cherishing such sentiments, it will hardly occasion
surprise that, in looking over the battle-pieces in the
foregoing collection, I have been tempted to withdraw or
modify some of them, fearful lest in presenting, though
but dramatically and by way of a poetic record, the pas-
sions and epithets of civil war, I might be contributing
to a bitterness which every sensible American must
wish at an end. So, too, with the emotion of victory as
reproduced on some pages, and particularly toward the
close. It should not be construed into an exultation
misapplied—an exultation as ungenerous as unwise, and
made to minister, however indirectly, to that kind of
censoriousness too apt to be produced in certain natures
<pb/>by success after trying reverses. Zeal is not of neces-
sity religion, neither is it always of the same essence
with poetry or patriotism.

</p><p>There were excesses which marked the conflict, most
of which are perhaps inseparable from a civil strife so
intense and prolonged, and involving warfare in some
border countries new and imperfectly civilized. Barbar-
ities also there were, for which the Southern people col-
lectively can hardly be held responsible, though perpe-
trated by ruffians in their name. But surely other qual-
ities—exalted ones—courage and fortitude matchless,
were likewise displayed, and largely; and justly may these
be held the characteristic traits, and not the former.

</p><p>In this view, what Northern writer, however patriotic,
but must revolt from acting on paper a part any way
akin to that of the live dog to the dead lion; and yet it
is right to rejoice for our triumph, so far as it may justly
imply an advance for our whole country and for humanity.

</p><p>Let it be held no reproach to any one that he pleads
for reasonable consideration for our late enemies, now
stricken down and unavoidably debarred, for the time,
from speaking through authorized agencies for them-
selves. Nothing has been urged here in the foolish
hope of conciliating those men—few in number, we
trust—who have resolved never to be reconciled to the
<pb/>Union. On such hearts every thing is thrown away
except it be religious commiseration, and the sincerest.
Yet let them call to mind that unhappy Secessionist, not
a military man, who with impious alacrity fired the first
shot of the Civil War at Sumter, and a little more than
four years afterward fired the last one into his own heart
at Richmond.

</p><p>Noble was the gesture into which patriotic passion
surprised the people in a utilitarian time and country;
yet the glory of the war falls short of its pathos—a
pathos which now at last ought to disarm all animosity.

</p><p>How many and earnest thoughts still rise, and how
hard to repress them. We feel what past years have
been, and years, unretarded years, shall come. May we
all have moderation; may we all show candor. Though,
perhaps, nothing could ultimately have averted the strife,
and though to treat of human actions is to deal wholly
with second causes, nevertheless, let us not cover up or
try to extenuate what, humanly speaking, is the truth—
amely, that those unfraternal denunciations, continued
through years, and which at last inflamed to deeds that
ended in bloodshed, were reciprocal; and that, had the
preponderating strength and the prospect of its unlim-
ited increase lain on the other side, on ours might have
lain those actions which now in our late opponents we
stigmatize under the name of Rebellion. As frankly
<pb/>let us own—what it would be unbecoming to parade
were foreigners concerned—that our triumph was won
not more by skill and bravery than by superior re-
sources and crushing numbers; that it was a triumph,
too, over a people for years politically misled by de-
signing men, and also by some honestly-erring men, who
from their position could not have been otherwise than
broadly influential; a people who, though, indeed, they
sought to perpetuate the curse of slavery, and even ex-
tend it, were not the authors of it, but (less fortunate,
not less righteous than we) were the fated inheritors;
a people who, having a like origin with ourselves, share
essentially in whatever worthy qualities we may possess.
No one can add to the lasting reproach which hopeless
defeat has now cast upon Secession by withholding the
recognition of these verities.

</p><p>Surely we ought to take it to heart that that kind of
pacification, based upon principles operating equally all
over the land, which lovers of their country yearn for,
and which our arms, though signally triumphant, did
not bring about, and which law-making, however anxious,
or energetic, or repressive, never by itself can achieve,
may yet be largely aided by generosity of sentiment
public and private. Some revisionary legislation and
adaptive is indispensable; but with this should harmo-
niously work another kind of prudence, not unallied
<pb/>with entire magnanimity. Benevolence and policy—
Christianity and Machiavelli—dissuade from penal se-
verities toward the subdued. Abstinence here is as ob-
ligatory as considerate care for our unfortunate fellow-
men late in bonds, and, if observed, would equally prove
to be wise forecast. The great qualities of the South,
those attested in the War, we can perilously alienate, or
we may make them nationally available at need.

</p><p>The blacks, in their infant pupilage to freedom, appeal
to the sympathies of every humane mind. The paternal
guardianship which for the interval government exercises
over them was prompted equally by duty and benevo-
lence. Yet such kindliness should not be allowed to
exclude kindliness to communities who stand nearer to
us in nature. For the future of the freed slaves we
may well be concerned; but the future of the whole
country, involving the future of the blacks, urges a par-
amount claim upon our anxiety. Effective benignity,
like the Nile, is not narrow in its bounty, and true
policy is always broad. To be sure, it is vain to
seek to glide, with moulded words, over the difficul-
ties of the situation. And for them who are neither
partisans, nor enthusiasts, nor theorists, nor cynics, there
are some doubts not readily to be solved. And there
are fears. Why is not the cessation of war now
at length attended with the settled calm of peace?
<pb/>Wherefore in a clear sky do we still turn our eyes to-
ward the South, as the Neapolitan, months after the
eruption, turns his toward Vesuvius? Do we dread lest
the repose may be deceptive? In the recent convul-
sion has the crater but shifted? Let us revere that sa-
cred uncertainty which forever impends over men and
nations. Those of us who always abhorred slavery as
an atheistical iniquity, gladly we join in the exulting
chorus of humanity over its downfall. But we should
remember that emancipation was accomplished not by
deliberate legislation; only through agonized violence
could so mighty a result be effected. In our natural
solicitude to confirm the benefit of liberty to the blacks,
let us forbear from measures of dubious constitutional
rightfulness toward our white countrymen—measures
of a nature to provoke, among other of the last evils,
exterminating hatred of race toward race. In imagina-
tion let us place ourselves in the unprecedented pos-
ition of the Southerners—their position as regards the
millions of ignorant manumitted slaves in their midst,
for whom some of us now claim the suffrage. Let us
be Christians toward our fellow-whites, as well as phi-
lanthropists toward the blacks, our fellow-men. In all
things, and toward all, we are enjoined to do as we
would be done by. Nor should we forget that benevo
ent desires, after passing a certain point, can not un-
<pb/>dertake their own fulfillment without incurring the risk
of evils beyond those sought to be remedied. Some-
thing may well be left to the graduated care of future
legislation, and to heaven. In one point of view the co-
existence of the two races in the South—whether the
negro be bond or free—seems (even as it did to Abra-
ham Lincoln) a grave evil. Emancipation has ridded
the country of the reproach, but not wholly of the ca-
lamity. Especially in the present transition period for
both races in the South, more or less of trouble may
not unreasonably be anticipated; but let us not here-
after be too swift to charge the blame exclusively in
any one quarter. With certain evils men must be more
or less patient. Our institutions have a potent diges-
tion, and may in time convert and assimilate to good
all elements thrown in, however originally alien.

</p><p>But, so far as immediate measures looking toward per-
manent Re-establishment are concerned, no considera-
tion should tempt us to pervert the national victory into
oppression for the vanquished. Should plausible prom-
ise of eventual good, or a deceptive or spurious sense
of duty, lead us to essay this, count we must on serious
consequences, not the least of which would be divisions
among the Northern adherents of the Union. Assured-
ly, if any honest Catos there be who thus far have gone
with us, no longer will they do so, but oppose us, and
<pb/>as resolutely as hitherto they have supported. But this
path of thought leads toward those waters of bitterness
from which one can only turn aside and be silent.

</p><p>But supposing Re-establishment so far advanced that
the Southern seats in Congress are occupied, and by
men qualified in accordance with those cardinal princi-
ples of representative government which hitherto have
prevailed in the land—what then? Why, the Congress-
men elected by the people of the South will—represent
the people of the South. This may seem a fiat con-
clusion; but, in view of the last five years, may there
not be latent significance in it? What will be the tem-
per of those Southern members? and, confronted by
them, what will be the mood of our own representa-
tives? In private life true reconciliation seldom follows
a violent quarrel; but, if subsequent intercourse be un-
avoidable, nice observances and mutual are indispensa-
ble to the prevention of a new rupture: Amity itself
can only be maintained by reciprocal respect, and true
friends are punctilious equals. On the floor of Con-
gress North and South are to come together after a
passionate duel, in which the South, though proving her
valor, has been made to bite the dust. Upon differ-
ences in debate shall acrimonious recriminations be ex-
changed? shall censorious superiority assumed by one
section provoke defiant self-assertion on the other? shall
<pb/>Manassas and Chickamauga be retorted for Chattanooga
and Richmond? Under the supposition that the full
Congress will be composed of gentlemen, all this is im-
possible. Yet, if otherwise, it needs no prophet of Is-
rael to foretell the end. The maintenance of Congres-
sional decency in the future will rest mainly with the
North. Rightly will more forbearance be required from
the North than the South, for the North is victor.

</p><p>But some there are who may deem these latter thoughts
inapplicable, and for this reason: Since the test-oath
operatively excludes from Congress all who in any way
participated in Secession, therefore none but Southern-
ers wholly in harmony with the North are eligible to
seats. This is true for the time being. But the oath
is alterable; and in the wonted fluctuations of parties
not improbably it will undergo alteration, assuming such
a form, perhaps, as not to bar the admission into the
National Legislature of men who represent the pop-
ulations lately in revolt. Such a result would involve
no violation of the principles of democratic government.
Not readily can one perceive how the political existence
of the millions of late Secessionists can permanently be
ignored by this Republic. The years of the war tried
our devotion to the Union; the time of peace may test
the sincerity of our faith in democracy.

</p><p>In no spirit of opposition, not by way of challenge,
<pb/>is any thing here thrown out. These thoughts are sin-
cere ones; they seem natural—inevitable. Here and
there they must have suggested themselves to many
thoughtful patriots. And, if they be just thoughts, ere
long they must have that weight with the public which
already they have had with individuals.

</p><p>For that heroic band—those children of the furnace
who, in regions like Texas and Tennessee, maintained
their fidelity through terrible trials—we of the North
felt for them, and profoundly we honor them. Yet pas-
sionate sympathy, with resentments so close as to be
almost domestic in their bitterness, would hardly in the
present juncture tend to discreet legislation. Were the
Unionists and Secessionists but as Guel-
hs and Ghibellines? If not, then far be it from a great nation now to
act in the spirit that animated a triumphant town-faction
in the Middle Ages. But crowding thoughts must at last
be checked; and, in times like the present, one who de-
sires to be impartially just in the expression of his views,
#x0027; moves as among sword-points presented on every side.

</p><p>Let us pray that the terrible historic tragedy of our
time may not have been enacted without instructing our
whole beloved country through terror and pity; and may
fulfillment verify in the end those expectations which
kindle the bards of Progress and Humanity.

</p><p>THE END.
