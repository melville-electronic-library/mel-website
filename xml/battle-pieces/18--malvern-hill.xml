Melville visited the Malvern Hill battlefield during his trip to Virginia in April 1864, where he purchased “a souvenir brick made from the clay of Malvern Hill” (Cohen 232). The opening reference to the elms at Malvern Hill may be sourced in <hi rend="italic">The Rebellion Record</hi> 5.266 (Cohen 231).</note></name>.</head>

In line 8, Melville may have drawn the graphic image of the dead lying with "fixed arms" from reports of men lying with "arms stretched upward at length” in <hi rend="italic">The Rebellion Record</hi> 5.268 (See NN <hi rend="italic">Published Poems</hi>, 639).</note>,</l>

	 <note xml:id="ref_21020">Ronald Giles reads the final stanza, in which the elms speak, as the trees' “rebuke” of human kind “for attempting to coerce an unnatural compassion,” of which the elms are not capable ("Malvern Hill," Explicator, 1987). Aaron Kramer places “Malvern Hill” in a constellation with other Battle-Pieces that address the theme of “nature’s uninterested continuity after a human catastrophe. He cites “Shiloh,” “The Stone Fleet,” “A Requiem for Soldiers Lost in Ocean Transports,” and “On a Natural Monument in a Field of Georgia” (Kramer, Melville’s Poetry: Toward the Enlarged Heart, 28).</note> -->
