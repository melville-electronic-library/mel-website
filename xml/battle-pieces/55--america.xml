<l><hi rend="smallcaps">Where</hi> the wings of a sunny Dome expand</l>
<l>I saw a Banner in gladsome air—</l>
<l>Starry, like Berenice&apos;s Hair—</l>
<!--
<note>Coma Berenices is the only modern constellation named  for a historical figure: Queen Berenice II of Egypt, wife of King Ptolemy Eugeretes (c. 248 B.C.E.) who sacrificed her long hair as a votive offering to Venus. [Allusion, astronomical]

<l>Afloat in broadened bravery there;</l>
<l>With undulating long-drawn flow,</l>
<l>As rolled Brazilian billows go</l>
<l>Voluminously o&apos;er the Line.</l>
<l>The Land reposed in peace below;</l>
<l rend="2em">The children in their glee</l>
<l>Were folded to the exulting heart</l>
<l rend="2em">Of young Maternity.</l>

<l>Later, and it streamed in fight</l>
<l rend="2em">When tempest mingled with the fray,</l>
<l>And over the spear-point of the shaft</l>
<l rend="2em">I saw the ambiguous lightning play.</l>
<l>Valor with Valor strove, and died:</l>
<l>Fierce was Despair, and cruel was Pride;</l>
<pb facs="/images/battle-pieces-v1/battle-pieces-i-0169.jpg"/>
<l>And the lorn Mother speechless stood,</l>
<l>Pale at the fury of her brood.</l>

<l>Yet later, and the silk did wind</l>
<l rend="4em">Her fair cold form;</l>
<l>Little availed the shining shroud,</l>
<l rend="2em">Though ruddy in hue, to cheer or warm.</l>
<l>A watcher looked upon her low, and said—</l>
<l>She sleeps, but sleeps, she is not dead.</l>
<l rend="2em">But in that sleep contortion showed</l>
<l>The terror of the vision there—</l>
<l rend="2em">A silent vision unavowed,</l>
<l>Revealing earth&apos;s foundation bare,</l>
<l rend="2em">And Gorgon in her hidden place.</l>
<!--
<note>A female creature from Greek mythology, such as Medusa, sometimes with hair made of snakes, and with a face so horrible it turned those who looked at her to stone. [Allusion, mythologocal] [Source, Hesiod's Theogony]
In the Aeneid, Gorgons lived in the entrance to the Underworld. [Source: Homer's The Aeneid];
</note>

<l>It was a thing of fear to see</l>
<l rend="2em">So foul a dream upon so fair a face,</l>
<l>And the dreamer lying in that starry shroud.</l>

<l>But from the trance she sudden broke—</l>
<l rend="2em">The trance, or death into promoted life;</l>
<l>At her feet a shivered yoke,</l>
<l>And in her aspect turned to heaven</l>
<l rend="2em">No trace of passion or of strife—</l>
<l><pb facs="/images/battle-pieces-v1/battle-pieces-i-0170.jpg"/>
A clear calm look. It spake of pain,</l>
<l>But such as purifies from stain—</l>
<l>Sharp pangs that never come again—</l>
<l rend="2em">And triumph repressed by knowledge meet,</l>
<l>Power dedicate, and hope grown wise,</l>
<l rend="2em">And youth matured for age&apos;s seat—</l>
<l>Law on her brow and empire in her eyes.</l>
<l rend="2em">So she, with graver air and lifted flag;</l>
<l>While the shadow, chased by light,</l>
<l>Fled along the far-drawn height,</l>
<l rend="2em">And left her on the crag.</l>
