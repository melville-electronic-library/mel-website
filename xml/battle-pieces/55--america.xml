Commonly known as Berenice's Hair, the constellation is named for Queen Berenice II of Egypt, wife of King Ptolemy III (c. 248 B.C.E.). Distraught over her new husband's departure for war, Berenice sacrificed her long hair to ensure Ptolemy's safe return from battle. The star cluster, situated between Leo and Ursa Major, is faint but visible in both hemispheres, and Melville could have witnessed it on one of his three Atlantic (i.e. "Brazilian") transits of the equator ("the Line").

<l>Afloat in broadened bravery there;</l>

<l rend="2em">When tempest mingled with the fray,</l>

<l>Valor with Valor strove, and died:</l>

An allegorical female figure also known as "Freedom Triumphant in War and Peace," she carries in either hand a sheathed sword and laurel wreath and wears a tiara of stars, which resonates with Melville's flag imagery.</note> speechless stood,</l>

<l>Yet later, and the silk did wind</l>
<l rend="4em">Her fair cold form;</l>
<l>Little availed the shining shroud,</l>
<l rend="2em">Though ruddy in hue, to cheer or warm.</l>
<l>A watcher looked upon her low, and said—</l>
<l>She sleeps, but sleeps, she is not dead.</l>
<l rend="2em">But in that sleep contortion showed</l>
<l>The terror of the vision there—</l>
<l rend="2em">A silent vision unavowed,</l>
<l>Revealing earth&apos;s foundation bare,</l>
<l rend="2em">And Gorgon in her hidden place.</l>

<l rend="2em">The trance, or death into promoted life;</l>

<l rend="2em">No trace of passion or of strife— <pb facs="/images/battle-pieces-v1/battle-pieces-i-0170.jpg"/></l>
<l>A clear calm look. It spake of pain,</l>
<l>But such as purifies from stain—</l>
<l>Sharp pangs that never come again—</l>
<l rend="2em">And triumph repressed by knowledge meet,</l>
<l>Power dedicate, and hope grown wise,</l>
<l rend="2em">And youth matured for age&apos;s seat—</l>
<l>Law on her brow and empire in her eyes.</l>
<l rend="2em">So she, with graver air and lifted flag;</l>
<l>While the shadow, chased by light,</l>
<l>Fled along the far-drawn height,</l>
