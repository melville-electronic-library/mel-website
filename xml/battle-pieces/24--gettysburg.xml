<l><hi rend="smallcaps">O pride</hi> of the days in prime of the months</l>

<l>Never his impious heart enlarged</l>

<l>He charged, and in that charge condensed</l>
<l n="10" rend="2em">His all of hate and all of fire;</l>
<l>He sought to blast us in his scorn,</l>
<l rend="4em">And wither us in his ire.</l>
<l>Before him went the shriek of shells—</l>
<l>Aerial screamings, taunts and yells;</l>
<l n="15">Then the three waves in flashed advance</l>

<l n="20" rend="2em">Which wild September gales have strown</l>
<l>With havoc on wreck, and dashed therewith</l>
<l rend="4em">Pale crews unknown—</l>
<l>Men, arms, and steeds. The evening sun</l>
<l>Died on the face of each lifeless one,</l>
<l n="25">And died along the winding marge of fight</l>
<l rend="2em">And searching-parties lone.</l>
</lg>

<l>Sloped on the hill the mounds were green,</l>
<l rend="2em">Our centre held that place of graves,</l>

<p>Among numerous head-stones or monuments on Cemetery Hill, marred or destroyed by the enemy's concentrated fire, was one, somewhat conspicuous, of a Federal officer killed before Richmond in 1862.</p>
<p>On the 4th of July, 1865, the Gettysburg National Cemetery, on the same height with the original burial-ground, was consecrated, and the corner-stone laid of a commemorative pile.</p>
