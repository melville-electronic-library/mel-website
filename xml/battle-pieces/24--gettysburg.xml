<l><hi rend="smallcaps">O pride</hi> of the days in prime of the months</l>
<l rend="2em">Now trebled in great renown,</l>
<l>When before the ark of our holy cause</l>
<l rend="4em">Fell <ref target="#ref_19136">Dagon</ref><note xml:id="ref_19136">The ancient Philistine fertility deity Dagon is often associated with fish and depicted as a merman. In 1 Samuel 5, an image of Dagon falls before the Ark of the Covenant.(Eric Meckley)</note> down—</l>
<l>Dagon foredoomed, who, armed and <ref target="#ref_20971">targed</ref><note xml:id="ref_20971">Targe is an Old English word for a small round shield.</note>,</l>
<l>Never his impious heart enlarged</l>
<l>Beyond that hour; God walled his power,</l>
<l>And <ref target="#ref_20974">there the last invader charged</ref><note xml:id="ref_20974">The Union victory at Gettysburg deflected the Confederacy's only invasion of Northern territory. (Eric Meckley)</note>.</l>

<l>He charged, and in that charge condensed</l>
<l rend="2em">His all of hate and all of fire;</l>
<l>He sought to blast us in his scorn,</l>
<l rend="4em">And wither us in his ire.</l>
<l>Before him went the shriek of shells—</l>
<l>Aerial screamings, taunts and yells;</l>
<l>Then the three waves in flashed advance</l>
<l rend="2em"><pb facs="/images/battle-pieces-v1/battle-pieces-i-0093.jpg"/>
Surged, but were met, and back they set:</l>
<l>Pride was repelled by sterner pride,</l>

<l>Before our lines it seemed a beach</l>
<l rend="2em">Which wild September gales have strown</l>
<l>With havoc on wreck, and dashed therewith</l>
<l rend="4em">Pale crews unknown—</l>
<l>Men, arms, and steeds. The evening sun</l>
<l>Died on the face of each lifeless one,</l>
<l>And died along the winding marge of fight</l>
<l rend="2em">And searching-parties lone.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Sloped on the hill the mounds were green,</l>
<l rend="2em">Our centre held that place of graves,</l>
<l>And some still hold it in their swoon,</l>
<l rend="2em">And over these a glory waves.</l>

<p>Among numerous head-stones or monuments on Cemetery Hill, marred or destroyed by the enemy's concentrated fire, was one, somewhat conspicuous, of a Federal officer killed before Richmond in 1862.</p>
<p>On the 4th of July, 1865, the Gettysburg National Cemetery, on the same height with the original burial-ground, was consecrated, and the corner-stone laid of a commemorative pile.</p>

<l>Shall soar transfigured in loftier light,</l>

<l>Soldier and priest with hymn and prayer</l>

<l rend="4em">Shall rest in honor there.</l>
