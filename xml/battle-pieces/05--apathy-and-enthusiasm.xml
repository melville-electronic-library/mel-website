					<head><hi rend="italic"><ref target="#ref_20498">Apathy and Enthusiasm</ref></hi><note xml:id="ref_20498">Cohen connects Melville's title with his 1854 short story "The Fiddler," in which Hautboy "seemed intuitively to hit the exact line between enthusiasm and apathy. It was plain that while Hautboy saw the world pretty much as it was, yet he did not thereotically espouse its bright side nor its dark side" (211). Garner comments on Melville's representation of the "numbness of the North after Lincoln's election with the "Easter" rising of the people the following spring" (62). Melville uses stark, contrasting terms throughout <hi rend="italic">Battle-Pieces</hi> as a way of showing the turmoil of both the events leading up to the Civil War. Melville forces the reader ponder the extremeness of the situation and to think about the existence of a middle space in between apathy and enthusiasm. Leading up to the War, the nation tried to find a middle space, but it soon learned that there could be none. Another example of this can be found in "Misgivings," where the speaker references "the world's fairest hope linked with man's foulest crime."<!-- need to re-do cross-ref links to other poems --></note>

Melville continually builds on his depictions of mothers. We bear witness to the "appealings of the mother" in "Apathy and Enthusiasm", and then we  feel the "anguish of maternal hearts" in "On the Slain Collegians." Even the nation itself is characterized as a "lorn Mother" standing "speechless" with "the flury of her brood" in "America." <!-- need to re-do cross-ref links to other poems --></note></l>

	<l>So the winter died despairing,</l>
	<l rend="2em">And the weary weeks of Lent;</l>
	<l>And the ice-bound rivers melted,</l>
	<l rend="2em">And the tomb of Faith was rent.</l>

	<l rend="2em">Came with springing of the grass,</l>

	<l rend="2em"><ref target="#ref_20500">In the age that went before.</ref><note xml:id="ref_20500">Cohen asserts that Melville may have relied on an editorial from the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> of April 16, 1861 entitled "The Resurrection of Patriotism" for some of the imagery in this section. The unbounding patriotism and enthusiasm for the War is present in the editorial. There is another part of the editorial, however, to which Melville may have been responding. The last line of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>article reads, "Whatever may be the character of the contest, we have no fears or misgivings as to the final issue." We should recall that Melville places the poem "Misgivings" directly after the "Portent." In other words, the reaction to John Brown as the portent of the War is not certainty, not apathy or enthusiasm, but misgivings.</note></l>

In Miltonic fashion, Melville depicts the battle of good vs. evil as being less a struggle than a matter of fact: Michael is "gigantical"; Satan is "but a dwarf." In Milton's <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, Satan poses little threat in combat against St. Michael and the divine hand of God. Through this allusion, Melville captures the early excitement of the War as being a matter of good vs. evil.</note></l>
