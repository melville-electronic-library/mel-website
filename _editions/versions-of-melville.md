## *THREE MODEL EDITIONS*

During his lifetime, Melville published nine book-length works of
fiction, a collection of tales, and four works of poetry. At his death,
among other documents, he left in manuscript several uncollected tales
(including *Billy Budd*), numerous poems (including *Weeds & Wildings*),
and a handful of reviews, including his literary manifesto "Hawthorne
and His Mosses." Print versions of most of Melville's manuscripts
appeared posthumously in print. For various reasons, almost every
Melville title exists in multiple versions, either in manuscript or
print, due to authorial or editorial revision. Changes to a work also
occur in forms of adaptive revision, with or without authorial
involvement, as in plays, films, opera, or even the cultural "meme." As
a body of work that exists in multiple versions, the entire corpus of
Melville's writing is a remarkable fluid text, and therefore a
considerable challenge, editorially and digitally.

MEL's editorial project—funded by NEH, first developed at Hofstra
University and its Digital Research Center (DRC), and since 2020 sustained by the
University of Chicago's CEDAR initiative—began by designing "model
editions" of three exemplary Melville works: *Moby-Dick*,
*Battle-Pieces*, and *Billy Budd*. By resolving the different editorial
and digital problems that each work poses, these models serve as
templates for MEL's editions of additional works. Why we chose these
three fluid texts as models for digital editing has to do with the
nature of print, manuscript, prose, poetry, and digital technology.

#### ***Moby-Dick***
First appearing in 1851 in virtually simultaneous American and  expurgated British first editions, Melville's best-known work is also a
significant example of a fluid text in print. In addition to the two
first editions, scholarly editors have created their own versions. For
instance, the standard Northwestern-Newberry (NN) edition of *Moby-Dick*
generally follows the American text but mixes into it elements from the
British edition; it corrects obvious errors but also adds new wordings
that represent what the NN editors believe Melville actually
intended. The Longman Critical Edition of *Moby-Dick*--a fluid-text
print edition edited by John Bryant and Haskell Springer--also follows
the American text and makes corrections of obvious errors, but it does
not mix versions. Instead, it provides a set of "revision narratives"
that demonstrate changes--regarding style, aesthetics, and matters of
sex, religion, or politics--made to Melville's text, either by Melville
himself or his British and subsequent scholarly editors.

To create our
fluid-text edition, titled ***Versions of Moby-Dick***, MEL adopts the
Longman Edition text for its Reading Text; it highlights and annotates
British variants (both expurgations and likely Melville revisions),
provides revision narratives explaining selected major changes, and
updates and the Longman textual and contextual annotations with links to
images and data in MELCat. An additional feature is MEL's side-by-side
display of the American and British volumes, with drop down tables of
contents for easy comparison. In future development, MEL will offer a
side-by-side collation of the American and British texts, which will
highlight differences and provide pop-up revision narratives explaining
all expurgations. MEL will also extend the navigation of the versions of
*Moby-Dick* to include adaptive revisions of the novel, in particular
the [John Huston and Ray Bradbury film "Moby Dick."](https://mel.netlify.app/adaptation)

Digitally, the challenge of *Moby-Dick* lies in establishing protocols
for the transcribing and TEI coding of a prose fiction, in print only. *Billy Budd* poses the entirely different problem of editing a fluid text that exists
fundamentally in a heavily revised manuscript but also in non-authorized, modern print transcriptions.

#### ***Billy Budd***
Melville left his completed but unpolished manuscript
of *Billy Budd* unpublished at the time of his death in 1891. The
manuscript is riddled with thousands of revisions, in pencil and ink,
that bear striking evidence of the writer's shifting intentions
throughout at least three versions, layered over 361 leaves,
representing at least eight stages of composition. The novella first
appeared in print in Raymond Weaver's 1924 transcription (corrected in
1928). More accurate transcriptions based on more ambitious analyses of
the manuscript appeared in F. Barron Freeman's 1948 version and in
Harrison Hayford and Merton M. Sealts, Jr.'s 1962 edition. A slightly
modified version of the Hayford and Sealts text appears in the 2017 NN
edition of *Billy Budd*. These four scholarly editions base their texts
on direct inspections of the *Billy Budd* manuscript,
located at Harvard's Houghton Library. Each of the three
twentieth-century transcriptions vary significantly from each other. The
1962 edition provides a "genetic transcription" as a textual apparatus,
which was also slightly by the NN edition. Apart from drawing upon the scholarship of predecessors, MEL's editors had the added benefit of digital magnification and fuller access to each leaf image in their transcription process.

The aim of MEL's ***Versions of Billy Budd*** is to assemble both
manuscript and print versions of the work. To meet the challenge of
manuscript transcription, MEL developed TextLab. This innovative tool
enables editors to mark-up revision sites directly on manuscript leaf images,
transcribe each leaf (including its revision texts), automatically code
the additions and deletions, and generate a "diplomatic transcription"
(a typographical simulation of each leaf or page). We then use this transcription
as a platform for creating and displaying revision sequences and narratives for each
revision site. TextLab also automatically generates MEL's base version
of the *Billy Budd* manuscript—essentially Melville's final reading
version with additions added and deletions deleted—which we then lightly edit into our Reading Text for *Billy Budd*. Eventually, we will collate this reading text with the three twentieth-century transcriptions and the NN
version of 2017.

The challenges of digitally editing *Billy Budd*, or any manuscript in revision,
is establishing TEI codes for identifying the various elements and attributes
of a single revision (additions and deletions and their placement, medium, hand, stage), developing an XSLT program, which transforms data into a reliable diplomatic transcription and base version, and devising a means by which editors can compose multiple revision sequences and narratives. These challenges were met
through the development of TextLab. Equally important are additional
layers of textual and contextual annotation created in the Juxta
Editions platform (now in its second iteration called FairCopy).

MEL's *Billy Budd* reading text is fully launched with the features
mentioned. Still to be addressed are collations in FairCopy with other editions and further links to adaptive revisions in play, opera, and film.

#### ***Battle-Pieces***
 Melville's first published volume of poetry, *Battle-Pieces and Aspects of the War*, poses other problems for digital editing. Although working drafts of these Civil War poems have not survived, evidence of Melville's post-production revisions appears in pencil on certain poems in two of his personal copies of the book. Apart from the difficult matter of coding Melville's intricate stanza structure and line indentations, *Battle-Pieces* presents the digital problem of layering handwritten revisions over text in print. Melville also published a handful of *Battle-Pieces* poems in magazines before the
volume's publication, and certain poems were reprinted in anthologies later in Melville's life. The challenge of integrating magazine and anthologized poetic texts along with Melville's penciled revisions is also addressed in the
modeling of data for *Battle-Pieces*.

The base version for MEL's ***Versions of Battle-Pieces*** edition is the text
of the first American edition. MEL editors continue to update textual,
contextual, and revision annotation to this reading text. An added feature is our
side-by-side display of the two personal copies of *Battle-Pieces*
displaying two stages of post-production revision: his bound and
corrected proofsheets (copy C) and his personal copy of the book with
post-publication revisions (copy A). Going forward, we will develop strategies
for linking Melville's magazine and anthologized versions of individual
*Battle-Pieces* poems via our editing of Melville's novella "Benito
Cereno," which also appeared in magazine installments.

Currently, MEL is working on editions of *Typee*, "Benito Cereno" and *Piazza Tales*, Melville’s Journals, and the Melville Family Correspondence.
