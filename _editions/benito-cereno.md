#### Background: Source, Magazine, Collection.

After the middling and then aggressively negative receptions of
*Moby-Dick* and *Pierre*, respectively, Melville turned to magazine
writing, for *Putnam's* and *Harper's* monthlies. Bookending this
four-year period of intense productivity (some sixteen tales, and the
serialized novel *Israel Potter*) are two masterpieces of the short
story form: "Bartleby, the Scrivener" (1853) and "Benito Cereno" (1855),
both closer in length to novellas. Melville slightly revised five of his
Putnam's stories, plus a new introductory tale "The Piazza," for his
story collection *The Piazza Tales* (1856). Eventually, MEL will edit
all of Melville's shorter works, including both the magazine and book
versions of his *Piazza Tales*. We begin with the challenge of "Benito
Cereno" because, like other works (in particular *Israel Potter*), it
was published serially and draws directly from a source work. In this
latter respect, MEL's editing of "Benito Cereno" will complement our
work on adaptive revision in *Typee*.

Anticipating modern, more sophisticated narrative techniques, Melville's
third-person narrator in "Benito Cereno" shifts point of view throughout
the novella. At first, readers are restricted to the perspective of
American merchant captain Amasa Delano, who boards a seemingly becalmed
slave ship, off the coast of Chile, in order to help its Spanish captain
Benito Cereno. Unbeknownst to Delano—and the reader—the enslaved
Africans have seized the ship and their ringleader Babo is now
orchestrating a cover-up. They act out their former slave status,
forcing Cereno to pretend that he is still their master. The idea (we
later learn) is that Delano will find nothing amiss and leave the slave
ship. Delano's benign stereotyping of the disguised revolters prevents
him from seeing through Babo's subterfuge, and Melville's third-person,
central consciousness narrator, reporting only what Delano thinks he
sees, is cagily complicit in the deception. (This narrative voice is the
first of Melville's unreliable, "con man" narrators.) But when the
cover-up is undone and the slaves recaptured, the narrative shifts to
Babo's trial and execution in Lima.

In this legal section, the reader learns the truth of the affair through
the trial's depositions by Spanish and African characters, delivered in
legalistic prose that emulates Melville's Delano source. In the trial's
aftermath and the tale's conclusion, Delano, unlike the haunted Cereno, is unmoved by the revelation of his having been duped by Babo and by
the startling disclosure in the depositions that Cereno's friend Aranda,
the owner of the ship's slaves, had been killed and, it is hinted,
ritually cannibalized, with his skeletal remains, hanging concealed in
sails from the foremast, to terrorize the Spanish crew. As a
representative of white indifference to African slavery, Delano allows
his stereotypes of Black people to blind him to the disguised revolt
played out under his very nose. The tale's final image is the piked head
of Babo, subtle architect of revolt, staring down at passersby in
Lima's plaza, and readers are left dangling amid the appalling realities
of slavery and Delano's stunning disinterest in the condition of Black
people.

#### Challenges in Editing "Benito Cereno."

As a fluid text, "Benito Cereno" seems to present only minor challenges. No working draft manuscript has been found, and differences in
wording between the novella's three installments in the October to
December 1855 issues of *Putnam's Monthly Magazine* and the print
version appearing in the 1856 *Piazza Tales* are few. That said, "Benito Cereno" poses problems regarding the **positioning** of the **installments** in *Putnam's* and of the tale within *Piazza Tales*. Also at issue is the narrative's relation to **Melville's source**. (For the range of versions, <a href="pdf/Editing-Benito-Cereno-Slide1.pdf/" target="_blank">click here</a>).

Narratives serialized in monthly magazine installments are common, as is
the altering of magazine texts later collected in book format, and these
textual conditions are problematic. On the one hand, the three
installments of "Benito Cereno" raise questions regarding the novella's
meaning in relation to other articles in the corresponding issues of
*Putnam's Monthly*. On the other, the book version raises questions
regarding the narrative's relation to the other tales in *The Piazza
Tales*, especially regarding forms of dispossession other than
slavery*.* Originally, Melville had planned to title his collection
"Benito Cereno & Other Sketches." Instead, he composed an introductory
piece titled "The Piazza," featuring an alienated woman living alone in
the woods, and he renamed the book accordingly, but with "Bartleby"
(featuring an alienated urban office worker) as the next tale. "Benito
Cereno" and its deceptive treatment of a harrowing slave revolt was
moved from first to third position in the collection. In editing "Benito Cereno," MEL will
provide textual and revision annotations regarding differences between
the magazine and book versions, as well as a set of contextual notes
regarding biography, South American politics, slavery, and the slave
trade. In addition, we will develop storyboards for an interactive
display enabling readers to explore the critical consequences of
Melville's *Piazza Tales* re-positionings.

Equally important is how to edit "Benito Cereno" in relation to its
principal source. Melville based his narrative on events befalling the
slave ship *Tryal* in 1800 as related in Chapter 18 of Amasa Delano's
1817 *Narrative of Voyages and Travels*. Editors and scholars since the
1960s recorded Melville's appropriations from this source, which include
not just events and characters but wordings, especially in the tale's
"deposition" section. But no digitally interactive editing of the Delano
source and Melville's narrative exists. In editing Melville's
transformations of the source language into his own wording, we give readers access
to a different notion of revision: source appropriation. MEL's
fluid-text approach considers appropriation as a version of adaptive
revision. It is one writer's rewriting of another writer's work,
altering the source to achieve (for better or worse) the adaptive
writer's personal goals. Thus, "Benito Cereno" may be taken as
Melville's "version of Delano."

Melville was an inveterate researcher, and decades of Melville source
studies give us concrete evidence of the role of adaptive revision in
his private creative process and public interactions with his culture.
MEL will edit Melville's revisions of Delano's narrative in two directions:
external and internal to the work itself. First, we will link Melville
passages in the third installment of the *Putnam's Magazine* version of
"Benito Cereno" externally to digitized page images and transcriptions
of originating passages in the Delano version. (For a visualization of one source appropriation, <a href="pdf/Editing-Benito-Cereno-Slide2.pdf/" target="_blank">click here</a>). Second, within Melville's narrative, we will link passages in the
third installment's "depositions" internally to the corresponding
fictionalized episodes of the first two installments. By integrating
external and internal editing, we enable readers a closer reading of
Melville's deceptive narrative technique, in the context of his
concealed source appropriations. In designing these annotations, we
treat appropriation without judgment. As with *Typee*, our goal is to
edit into visibility otherwise invisible revisions in "Benito Cereno,"
involving source, narrative, and collection, to make them available to
readers for their independent interpretation.

For decades, *Typee* and "Benito Cereno" have been taught in schools and
universities for their exposures of imperialism, slavery, resistance,
cultural difference, dispossession, and stereotyping. Neither has been
reliably edited in a digital platform. By focusing on the editing of
Melville's works as fluid texts, we broaden the scope of interpretation
giving readers unprecedented access to new kinds of textual evidence of
Melville's evolving consciousness for use in scholarly studies and
classroom projects. In this regard, MEL Associate Director Wyn Kelley,
in coordination with her home institution MIT's DH Lab, is developing
courses on digital editing that will use MEL editions (and "Benito
Cereno" in particular).

#### Work in Progress.
In December 2020, MEL downloaded from the Hathi Trust catalogue
page images and their corresponding OCR texts for the Putnam's and
*Piazza Tales* versions of "Benito Cereno" and for Chapter 18 of Amasa
Delano's *Narrative*. In 2021, MEL editors will correct any dirty OCR
and proof the texts against the page images (retaining, of course, any typos and
irregularities of the original. Editors will work with the University of
Chicago's CEDAR and OCHRE staffs to curate these base versions into the
MEL database.
