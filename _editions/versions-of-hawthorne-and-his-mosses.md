#### Background: Revising a Manifesto.

Melville's review essay of Hawthorne's *Mosses from an Old Manse* is now
the most famous literary manifesto of the American nineteenth century,
though it did not resurface until 1922 or gain much currency until
Edmund Wilson's inclusion of it in his 1943 anthology, *The Shock of Recognition*, which takes its title from Melville's phrasing. "Mosses" argues for a uniquely
American national literature (one awaiting recognition along the banks
of the Ohio) as well as an enduring place for American genius in world
literature. At the same time, it praises Hawthorne for an aesthetics of
repose that compresses bright and dark visions.

As a literary document, the essay poses editorial and digital
challenges. Because "Mosses" exists as a significantly revised fair-copy
manuscript, only one published version in his lifetime, and several modern
versions, editors have multiple options in what they choose to print. By
giving access to all options, MEL's proposed edition of "Hawthorne and
His Mosses" will give readers a chance to investigate changes found in
the different versions of Melville's remarkable manifesto. Because
modern editors differ on how to edit "Mosses," Melville's essay is also
an example of how scholarly editions contribute to and extend a literary
work as a fluid text.

#### Challenges in Editing "Mosses."

Melville submitted a fair-copy manuscript of "Mosses," inscribed in his
wife Elizabeth Shaw Melville's hand, to their friend Evert A. Duyckinck,
for publication in his journal *The Literary World* (LW). The
manuscript, located at NYPL, includes punctuation and corrections in
Melville's hand and 100 other revisions by both Melville and Duyckinck.
The LW print version reproduces these manuscript revisions.

Arguing in their 1987 edition of the essay that Melville had no choice
but to comply with Duyckinck's changes and that the unrevised fair-copy
text more closely represents Melville's final intentions, the
Northwestern-Newberry editors rejected the revised LW print version as
their copy-text in favor of the underlying, unrevised fair-copy
manuscript version Melville first submitted. To this base version, they
added selected authorial and editorial changes, including some
emendations of their own. Later on, in Hershel Parker's separate edition
of "Mosses," included as back matter in his 2002 Norton Critical Edition
of *Moby-Dick*, Parker changed at least one word in the text: he emended
the word *scared* in Melville's metaphor of Truth as being "forced to
fly like a scared white doe in the woodlands," changing it to
*sacred* (523). In 2017, arguing that the LW print
version represents a more "hemispheric" rather than singularly
nationalistic perspective, Robert S. Levine adopted the LW version for his edition of the *Norton Anthology of American Literature*, in place of the NN manuscript version that had been used in previous editions. In their
separate, variant texts, Parker and Levine have created further
instantiations of Melville's fluid text, as did Melville himself,
Elizabeth Melville, Duyckinck, and the NN edition before them.

#### Work in Progress.

Valid arguments exist for adopting either the manuscript or print
version, but rather than excluding one version for the other—as
anthologizers have done—MEL's edition of "Mosses" will follow a
strategy of inclusion. We will use TextLab to transcribe the fair-copy
manuscript and its revisions, create a diplomatic transcription and base version, and compose a set of manuscript revision narratives. We
will collate the manuscript base version against the print version,
highlight changes, and compose additional print revision narratives. Our
fluid-text edition will encourage closer analysis of the fair-copy manuscript,
revised manuscript, and the first *Literary World* print version of
Melville's manifesto. We will then compare these historical versions
with Wilson's, NN's, Parker's, and Levine's anthologized versions. With this array of texts, readers will have new openings for their own
interpretation of Melville's "Hawthorne and his Mosses."
