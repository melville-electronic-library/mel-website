#### Background: A Sense of Place.

Melville's writings draw directly from his travels, though he also
"traveled" imaginatively, through research and invention, to places he
never visited. Lamentably, journals of Melville's early and most
extensive travels—to Liverpool (1839), to the Mississippi and back
(1840), and to the Pacific (1841-1844)—either do not exist or have not
been found. However, Melville's later travels during his life as a
published writer—to London and Northern Europe (1849-50), the
Mediterranean and Middle East (1856-57), and San Francisco (1860)—are
recorded in three travel journals, which give us concrete evidence of
his "geographical imagination." The notebooks for these journals, all in
Melville's hand, are held by Houghton Library, and were comprehensively
assembled and transcribed in the 1989 NN *Journals* edition.

#### Challenges of Editing the Journals.

Naturally, the journals are a significant resource for establishing the
importance of travel in Melville biography—a sufficient reason for
editing them digitally—even though they do not, strictly speaking,
appear to be fluid texts. That is, they are unique documents with little
internal revision and were not printed in Melville's lifetime, or even
until the mid-twentieth century. However, as evidence of Melville's
creative process, they are like any source Melville might have
researched in his writing, especially his late poetry. As a form of
self-appropriation, Melville's use of his journals is an originating
foundation for his transformations of place and event into images and
ideas in later imaginative works. These acts of revision inform our
digital editing of the journals as fluid texts.

MEL's pursuit of Melville's geographical imagination began with our
editing of *Moby-Dick*. MEL editors Wyn Kelley and Brian Yothers used
MELCat to annotate place names in the novel and created a searchable
[database](/pdf/mel_travel_grid.pdf) of 1500 geo-coordinates associated with all places (real,
invented) referenced in *Moby-Dick* alone.

In a related effort, John Bryant worked with Jamie Folsom and Hofstra's
Digital Research Center to develop the mapping, timeline, and annotation
tool [**Itinerary**](http://hofstra.github.io/itinerary/videos/) as a way to edit and display Melville's
Journals. Bryant developed a test case, titled ["Melville in Rome,"](http://hofstra.github.io/itinerary/melville-in-rome/) which used data recorded in Melville's journal to follow a given
day in Melville's month-long tour of the city in 1857. Further
development of Itinerary enabled Wyn Kelley to create a fuller project,
["Melville in London,"](hofstra.github.io/itinerary/melville-in-london/.)
which included enhanced functionality, enabling editors to link TextLab
transcriptions of journal texts, place images, and print versions of
Melville's works for display on both historical and satellite maps of
London.

#### Mapping as Editing: The Route Narrative.

In our view, digital mapping is not simply an ancillary visualization
but a form of scholarly editing that assists readers, biographers, and
critics in linking Melville's journal entries and imaginative texts to
time and place. As an editing tool, **Itinerary** engages editors in the
problem of reconstructing travel routes by facilitating the composition
of "route narratives"—similar to TextLab's "revision
narratives"—that track Melville's possible routes on the map. To
explain: Melville's journal generally documents places visited and the
order Melville visited them but rarely indicates the exact route—that
is, specific streets, bridges, alleys, and byways—connecting the
places. By pinpointing the places on a map, we can better infer the
likely and alternative routes Melville could have taken to connect the
dots, and thereby better assess what he might have seen or missed seeing
on his daily tours. Itinerary's "route narrative" function enables this
kind of closer reading of Melville's travel.

#### Work in Progress.

Our work on the Rome and London Itinerary projects serves as models for
Melville's touring in 1857 of other cities and sights in Italy, France,
Germany, Greece, Egypt, Jerusalem and its environs. Thus far, we have
acquired leaf images of the 355 journal leaves from Houghton Library,
uploaded them to TextLab, and transcribed most of the Rome and London
sections.
