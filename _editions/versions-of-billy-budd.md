![A sailor's uniform](/images/shirt2.jpg){:class="col-xs-3 img-responsive"} *Billy Budd*, Melville’s last fiction, is his second most familiar work. As with *Moby-Dick*, the novella has devoted readerships in academe, the arts, and the popular culture. It has been the center of critical controversies regarding political resistance and Christian acceptance, authority and duty, masculinity and beauty, fathers and sons, romance and irony, and Melville biography. It continues to be a seminal text in fields of literary study worldwide, including law, war, gender, sexuality, and the editing of manuscripts.

But unlike *Moby-Dick*, which emerged in 1851 in two radically different first editions, *Billy Budd* was never published in Melville’s lifetime. It exists as a manuscript that different generations of scholars have transcribed into significantly different print versions. At the time of his death in 1891, Melville had “completed” his novella to the extent that its plot and characters had been developed into a coherent whole. But the manuscript is far from polished, and its many leaves and leaf fragments reveal a complex revision history in which the narrative evolved through at least three versions and eight stages of composition. These layered manuscript versions along with the variant scholarly transcriptions make Billy Budd Melville’s most complex [fluid text](https://mel.netlify.app/what-is-a-fluid-text).  

MEL’s *Versions of Billy Budd* gives the reader unprecedented access to the Billy Budd manuscript. The edition’s Reading Text, with its textual and contextual annotations, also links readers to MEL’s TextLab platform, its display of all manuscript leaves, a diplomatic transcription of each leaf identifying all revision sites, a base version representing Melville’s final revised version, and a set of revision annotations that sequence selected revisions and narrate the how and why of each revision sequence. Introductions explaining these features in more detail, our coding of revisions, and emendations of the base version into the reading text are reached by the links to the right.
