Because Melville’s works are “fluid texts”—they exist in multiple versions due to authorial, editorial, and adaptive revision—our digital editions also enable you to navigate the versions of Melville’s work, so that you may get a closer look at his creative process and at the cultural conditions that motivated him, his editors, or adaptors to make changes to his texts.  To learn more about fluid texts, go to [What is a Fluid Text](/what-is-a-fluid-text.html).
