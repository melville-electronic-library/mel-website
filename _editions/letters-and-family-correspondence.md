kground: Melville Letters & Family Networks.

The 1993 Northwestern-Newberry *Correspondence* edition includes texts
of 313 letters by Melville and entries on 237 unlocated letters alluded
to in other letters. Also included are 88 letters written to Melville
and 305 entries with allusions to correspondence, including letters to
publishers, for which only partial texts exist. These letters and NN
editor Lynn Horth's wealth of correspondence information have not been
digitized.

Nor has the Melville family correspondence from parents, siblings,
cousins, and in-laws been edited. This untapped resource is a
biographical and critical opening into Melville's formative and
productive years. NYPL holds the largest cache of family correspondence
in three collections. Over 300 unedited letters (discovered in 1983 and known as the Augusta Papers) stand separately from a pre-existing
collection of another two hundred letters. Both sets of family
correspondence, organized by letter-writer in individual folders, are
held in the Gansevoort-Lansing Collection. NYPL's Duyckinck Collection
also contains a score of Melville and Melville family letters. Other
important holdings are at Houghton, Berkshire Athenaeum, Beinecke,
Boston Public, and UVa libraries, with single items located at 31 other
repositories. Scholars, including Bryant, Kelley, Lori Robertson-Lorant,
and Hershel Parker, have used their independent transcriptions of these
unedited letters in their scholarship, and yet the full critical impact
of this network of correspondence cannot be realized until all letters
have been digitized and transcribed.

#### Challenges of Editing Correspondence.

In developing MEL's correspondence edition, we will explore ways to code
content in TEI and curate correspondence data in OCHRE so that we may
sort and display letters by various filters, including date, place,
writer, recipient, people and events referenced, and repository. We also
aim to "network" the correspondence in ways that will not only facilitate the tracking of letter-writing behaviors but also integrate by date Melville's familiar
literary letters alongside the family correspondence as a way to examine more
concretely the writer's growth in the context of his domestic world and the family's influence on his writing.

#### Work in Progress.

In support of their individual research projects, MEL Director Bryant
and Associate Director Kelley have created, over the years,
transcriptions of correspondence based on their independent, direct
inspections of selected letters at NYPL. In 2017, they and MEL
Associate Director Christopher Ohge and MEL researcher Rebecca Cheong
initiated a project for digitally editing both Melville's Letters and
the Melville Family Correspondence. In 2018, Bryant downloaded images
from the already digitized Duyckinck Collection from the NYPL online
catalogue. NYPL's Gansevoort-Lansing family letters were made available
in 2019. Bryant created an Excel file for registering correspondence
metadata for the Augusta Papers, and Cheong is populating a similar file
for the Melville letters published in NN *Correspondence*. These files
will assist in further curation of correspondence data in OCHRE.
