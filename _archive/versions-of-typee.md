#### Background: Manuscript, Print, and Adaptation.

*Typee* (1846), Melville's first and (in his lifetime) his most popular book, is based on his desertion in 1842, with Richard Tobias Greene, from their whaling ship *Acushnet*, their retreat into the wilderness of the Marquesan Island of
Nuku Hiva, their habitation in Taipivai valley among the Taipi, a
putative cannibal tribe, and their separate escapes from the valley and
island. The first-person adventure narrative mixes biographical fact and
fictional embellishments in ways that explore the psychological, sexual,
and political ramifications of Melville's encounter with an indigenous
culture soon to be dismantled by American and European colonial
interventions. Melville's first book also exists in multiple versions in
manuscript, in various revised print editions, and in different kinds of
adaptation. More than any other work in the Melville corpus, *Typee* is
Melville's fullest fluid text. Editing *Typee* as a fluid text of such scope and
integrating it into MEL's digital platform pose significant navigational
and technical challenges.

The versions of *Typee* represent a full range of <a href="pdf/EditingTypeeSampleSlides.pdf/â€œ target="_blank">authorial, editorial,
and adaptive revisions</a>. Melville's 1845
first draft manuscript--a three-chapter fragment--consists of
extensive revisions, each a potential opening into new interpretations
of the book. For instance, in one pattern of revision, Melville
consistently deletes the word *savage* in favor of two other, more
culturally neutral descriptors, *native* and *islander*, which suggests
that the writer's understanding of Polynesian civilization grew not only
as he wrote but also because he wrote. In this kind of self-discovery
that came with writing out and revising his feelings, Melville also
began to articulate his sexual anxieties and multicultural
consciousness. Manuscript revisions reveal Melville working through his
narrator Tommo's rivalry with his companion Greene, renamed "Toby," over
Tommo's island lover Fayaway, whom he abandons in his escape from the
island. In other episodes, revisions help us unpack Melville's growing
awareness of the political implications of his "whiteness." They also
let us follow Melville's attempt to "interpret" Polynesian language and
his decision to westernize words, such as changing his lover Faaua's
name to "Fayaway." Our digital fluid-text editing of *Typee*, beginning
with Melville's manuscript revisions, will enable scholars to analyze
other revision patterns in subsequent print versions that reveal
Melville's first unfoldings as an evolving writer and thinker.

*Typee*'s print versions involve different kinds of revision. When we
compare the numerous revised passages in the 1845 manuscript to the
first British edition of February 1846 (Brit1), we detect an equally
staggering number of changes. In addition, Bryant's analysis of the
manuscript in his 2008 *Melville Unfolding* also argues that Melville
had originally conceived of *Typee* as much shorter, and that he later
doubled its size by interspersing, in various stages of composition,
digressive chapters, some merely factual. Others, however, were inspired by his
angry response to his sources (in particular Charles Stewart and David Porter) regarding Polynesian sexuality, religion, and cannibalism.

Despite *Typee*'s international success, the religious press criticized
Melville's sexual liberality, attacks on missionary colonizers, and defense of
pagan Polynesian culture. Hints of this discontent among readers are
reflected in minor expurgations made by Melville's first American editor
John Wiley for the first American edition of March 1846 (Am1). Later,
Melville consented to heavier cuts of sexual, political, and religious
content in Wiley's American Revised edition of August 1846 (AmRev),
content found mostly in the very angry digressions he had added during
the composition of *Typee*. In the American Revised version, Melville
also removed the book's appendix with its controversial defense of the temporary
1843 British seizure of Hawai'i and replaced it with his brief
recounting of Richard Tobias Greene's escape from Taipivai, titled "The Story
of Toby." Finally, just before his death in 1891, Melville gave
instructions for more revisions to *Typee*, including the restoration of
one expurgation, in a posthumous 1892 edition. When edited together, the
full range of manuscript and print revision will provide openings for
new interpretation of Melville's shifting intentions for *Typee*. The
ways in which Melville's readers adapted *Typee* will tell us even more.

Adaptation is a familiar phenomenon and, along with manuscript and print
revision, is a third extension of the fluid text. It includes
translations; "announced" adaptations in plays, films, and illustrated
editions; bowdlerizations, abridgments, children's books, and comics;
and cultural memes. Adaptations do more than provide evidence of a
writer's reputation: They represent a culture's way of re-writing the
work itself; they are an interpretation of the work and an embodiment of
the adaptor's mediation of the work for expanding audiences in an
evolving culture. What are the deeper cultural anxieties that compel us
to revise another person's writing into an adaptive work that is
essentially a reflection of ourselves? Incorporating these kinds of "adaptive revisions" into our editing of *Typee* will help scholars address this and other questions more concretely.

Adaptations of *Typee* emerged almost immediately with Samuel Goodrich's sanitized excerpts for children in an 1847 number of *Robert Merry's Museum*. Various illustrated editions, two comic books, and two adventure films appeared in the early to mid-twentieth century. These were matched by the
emergence of the 1968 NN scholarly edition and several critical,
teaching, and popular editions at the turn of the twenty-first century.
*Typee* was the first Melville book to be translated, as early as 1847
(in German), but the twentieth century witnessed an eruption of *Typee*
translations especially in Romance languages. **(See Attachment 6, Sample
8.)** The varied adaptive versions of Melville's first book
expand interpretive possibilities in equally varied fields, including
children's literature, translation studies, reader response, and book
history.

#### Challenges in Editing *Typee*.

Existing critical editions of *Typee* are themselves a
kind of adaptive revision. Currently, the now-standard scholarly edition
of *Typee* is the mixed-version or "eclectic" text released in 1968 as
the first volume of the Northwestern-Newberry *Writings of Herman
Melville* (NN). Soon after Melville's manuscript fragment was discovered
in 1983, Bryant began transcribing the manuscript, and versions of his
transcription emerged first in his Penguin edition of *Typee* (1996,
rev. 2005). His online [*Herman Melville's Typee*](https://rotunda.upress.virginia.edu/login.xqy) (UVa Press Rotunda
Imprint 2006) included all manuscript leaf images, PDF diplomatic
transcriptions of each page, and hyperlinked revision sequences and
narratives. In 2009, it was the second digital edition to receive the MLA-CSE seal. Bryant's *Melville Unfolding* (Michigan 2008) includes, as an appendix,
a print version of the Rotunda edition's transcription and sample
revision narratives.

Both the NN edition of *Typee* and the Rotunda edition of the *Typee*
manuscript are problematic. In following the standard practice of
critical editing of its day, the NN edition aims to represent a
"private" Melville not constrained by publishers or unduly coerced into
expurgation by censorious readerships. They achieved their reading text
by emending their first British edition copy text with changes they
deemed to have been authorized by Melville, selected from Melville's
revised (but also expurgated) American edition. Even though Melville
seems to have been complicit in the expurgation of his own work, the NN
editors decided not to honor these American Revised Edition changes but
nevertheless added into their own reading text of *Typee* other
such revisions they deemed to be consistent with Melville's final
intentions as evident in the first British edition. This mixing of
versions--a hallmark of "eclectic" critical editing--necessarily
obscures the moments of revision in Melville's shifting rather than
"final" intentions. In addition, the NN edition's decision to place all
evidence of Melville's revisions into a hard-to-unpack textual apparatus
further removes readers from the edition's revision data. Worse, in the
reprinting of the NN reading text for popular editions, the textual
apparatus is invariably removed so that scholars, instructors, and
students have had diminishing contact with the *Typee* revision data.

Bryant's Rotunda Edition is differently problematic. Because it can be
accessed only through subscription, it has limited online circulation.
Moreover, its intended focus on the manuscript gives only a portion of
the full story of Melville's revisions to *Typee*. Not surprisingly, its
technology is already out of date. For instance, the Rotunda diplomatic transcription, base version, and revision sequences and narratives are created manually and not coded in TEI.

*Typee*'s complex history of revision in manuscript, print, adaptation,
translation, and scholarly edition is ideally suited for digital
fluid-text editing. The goal of such an edition is to offer users a
central, pleasurable reading experience of *Typee* while at the
same giving readers options to go deeper into their own experience of the
scholarly retrieval of Melville's revision process. But integrating
*Typee*'s versions on a navigable platform, and one that
interoperates with MEL's other fluid-text editions, poses significant
editorial and technological challenges.

Editorially, MEL's proposed fluid-text edition of *Typee* will not mix
versions (as does the NN *Typee*) but will edit each version separately, selecting one version--a composite of Brit1 and "The Story of Toby"
from AmRev--as a "base version" with links to the full range of
manuscript, print, and adaptive revisions. Technologically, this
approach will be facilitated by MEL's transition to the atomized
database platform called OCHRE, developed along with the University of Chicago's
CEDAR digital humanities initiative, of which MEL is a project
partner.

The challenge is to present the complex sequence of versions in a way
that does not overwhelm readers but encourages them to explore revisions
on their own terms. In ways already adopted in MEL's *Moby-Dick* and
*Billy Budd* editions, MEL will create a single, pleasurable reading
text (a lightly edited and coded iteration of the aforementioned "base
version") of *Typee*, with three sets of on-the-page annotations. These
are 1) **textual notes** that record authorial variants in spelling and
punctuation; 2) **contextual notes** addresing biographical, historical,
and cultural references; and 3) **revision notes** that link
substantive variants (manuscript revisions, expurgations, adaptations)
to explanatory revision sequences and narratives. Readers of MEL's
reading text of *Typee* will be able to filter any combination of these
three forms of annotation, or none at all.

MEL's goal is a long-held
aspiration of scholarly editing: to balance the pleasure of reading with
layers of detailed but equally pleasurable scholarship. Because of the highly
granularized nature of the OCHRE database, the base version, reading
text, and annotation affordances can be readily achieved through
OCHRE-generated APIs and interface development in Performant Software's
FairCopy critical editing platform (the newest iteration of Performant's
Juxta Editions, used for displaying MEL's model editions, *Moby-Dick*,
*Billy Budd*, and *Battle-Pieces*).

Unlike textual and contextual annotation, effective revision annotation
is particularly challenging for several reasons. While we know revisions
occur over time, we cannot be certain of their exact sequencing.
Different editors will discern different orderings of revision steps; or
they may agree on a single sequence but differ on the revision narrative
that explains those same steps. Discerning the phenomena of revision is
debatable. But since making the debate accessible is the mission of
annotation, an edition's revision notes must accommodate differing
revision sequences and narratives. Accordingly, MEL's digital tools
store and display alternative revision sequences and narratives, as is
evident in our fluid-text edition of *Billy Budd*, achieved through
MEL's TextLab technology. Our transition to CEDAR and its OCHRE database
technology along with OCHRE's work with Performant will help MEL adapt
our approach to revision annotation first developed for *Billy Budd* to
the fuller range of revision found in *Typee*, enabling us to integrate
manuscript, print, and adaptive versions and help MEL more fully realize
its goal of making annotation a place for discourse about revision.

#### Work in Progress.
Starting in December 2020, MEL received Rotunda XML for its *Typee* manuscript base version, revision narratives, and
Brit1 texts and permission from University of Virginia
Press, and we began re-transcribing the manuscript leaf images (supplied
by NYPL) in TextLab. In 2021, we will work with The Newberry Library
to digitize the relevant print versions of *Typee* and with University
of Chicago's OCHRE staff to curate those print texts.
