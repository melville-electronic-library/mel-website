#### Background: Adaptive Revision

The familiar phenomenon of Adaptation is an extension of the fluid text
that embraces a remarkable range of genres and media: not only
"announced" adaptations in plays, opera, films but also bowdlerizations,
abridgments, illustrated editions, children's versions, comic books, art
works, popular music, and even cultural memes. Translation is probably the most
transformative version of adaptation, as every word of the original is
revised into the idiom of a different language.

Standard scholarly editions may mention or even list adaptations as
evidence of a writer's reputation. But because adaptation is almost
always non-authorial, generally unauthorized, and often posthumous, editors
seeking only to establish an author's intended text have no theoretical
basis for editing adaptations alongside the authorial original. However,
in fluid-text editing, adaptation is taken as a form of revision, and
what we call "adaptive revisions" are versions of the original,
regardless of authorship. Broadly conceived, adaptations represent a
culture's re-writing, indeed interpretation, of the work itself; they
embody the adaptors' transformation of the work, in their own image (so
to speak), which may either affirm or resist an audience's expectations,
needs, and ideologies in an evolving culture. The study of adaptation
explores the deeper cultural anxieties that compel adaptors to revise
another person's writing, or compel audiences to provide markets
for these adaptive versions. Fluid-text editing seeks to establish an integrated
corpus of originating works and versions for the emerging field of
Adaptation Studies.

#### Challenges in Editing Adaptive Revision

Editing Adaptation as an integral part of a writer's fluid-texts is
daunting even in a digital environment like MEL. We will address the
challenge as part of our editing of *Typee* and "Benito Cereno," taking
on two kinds of adaptive revision, each radiating in a different
direction from the focal work. Our conventional notion is that
adaptation is "post-original"; it derives from a preceding originating
work. But a so called "original" is itself the result of adaptive revision when the writer appropriates—that is revises—a source in the making of that writer's "original." Source appropriation is essentially "pre-original" adaptation.

Though *Typee* draws upon many sources, MEL's editing of adaptive
revision in *Typee* will concentrate on a range of post-original works.
As noted in [Editing *Typee*](https://mel.netlify.app/versions-of-typee), adaptations of *Typee* (1846)
emerged almost immediately in 1847 with Samuel Goodrich's sanitized
excerpts in the children's magazine *Robert Merry's Museum*. Also that
year, the book was translated into German. The twentieth century saw the
emergence of illustrated editions, comic books, an unproduced
screenplay, and two adventure films, as well as the eruption of *Typee*
translations in various Romance languages. Editing works like these begins
with building a Descriptive Bibliography that lists and sequentializes
the corpus of adaptive revisions. Apart from digitizing texts, images of
art works and books, and audio-visual recordings, the task of giving users access to adaptations requires their curation in a robust database, like OCHRE,
capable of accommodating a full range of media formats.

Navigating revisions from text-only versions in manuscript and print to
similarly textual adaptive versions requires editors to match (or
"collate") comparable words, lines, paragraphs, stanzas, scenes, and
episodes, which, in adaptation, may bear only remote resemblance to the
original, or may not exist at all. The challenge of this kind of
***asymmetric collation*** (that is, comparing dissimilar rather than
similar textual units) is compounded when we consider the ***intermedial
collation*** of words and images, in the visual, musical, and kinetic
arts.

The pre-originating dimension in adaptation is a writer's use of
sources, a phenomenon discussed more fully in [Editing "Benito
Cereno"](https://mel.netlify.app/benito-cereno). Though Melville drew heavily from personal experience in most
of his writing, he relied on research to supplement his experiences and
often enough quoted or appropriated without acknowledgment sources into
his fictions. "Benito Cereno" is essentially a
retelling of events found in Chapter 18 of Amasa Delano's 1817
*Narrative of Voyages and Travels* that includes exact and revised word
borrowings. In MEL's fluid-text approach, we consider "Benito Cereno" to
be essentially Melville's "version of Delano." With this critical
perspective and in light of the volatile pre-Civil War years in which
"Benito Cereno" appeared, Melville's adaptive revision of Delano is a
cultural transformation of an old story for a new audience that
challenges antebellum complacencies. How Melville transforms Delano's
language is concrete evidence of the dynamics of Melville's narrative
technique.

Our integrating of the Delano source and "Benito Cereno" will serve as a
model for future editing of Melville's use of other sources in other
Melville works. Some sources can be stored in MEL's Archive, but our
goal is also to link MEL to sources collected in other archives, most
notably [*Melville's Marginalia Online*](https://mel.netlify.app/sources) (MMO), a digital archive of books from Melville's personal library, directed by Steven Olsen-Smith. Eventually, too, we hope to link MEL editions to our collection of
Melville's art prints and to *Melville's Print Collection Online*
(MPCO), curated by Robert K. Wallace. Negotiations among MEL, MMO, and
MPCO are underway to develop shared technologies that will enable the
three sites to interoperate.

#### Work in Progress.
MEL is sponsoring editorial, critical, and pedagogical projects related
to adaptation that will be featured in the Projects section of our
website.

* Adaptation Studies specialist Jaime Campomar (George Washington
University) has been developing a Film Adaptation project featuring John Huston's 1956 film "Moby Dick," Ray Bradbury's screenplay, and Steven Grimes's story boards. Campomar's work will inform the development of our editorial protocols for adaptive revision. For more on the project, including a sample collation of the Bradbury screenplay and *Moby-Dick* and sample storyboards, follow the link to the right.

* American literature specialist Pilar Martínez Benedi (University of
Aquila), as a Visiting Scholar at Loyola University (Chicago), will
study "Melville in Translation" at The Newberry Library and
work with MEL to develop digital protocols for the fluid-text analysis
of translation as adaptation. For storyboards describing a projected critical "translation tool," which collates translated and Melville original texts, <a href="pdf/translation-tool.pdf/" target="_blank">click here</a>.

*  MEL Associate Director Wyn Kelley will work with MIT's DH Lab and use MEL's "Benito Cereno" Archival and Editorial resources to develop courses on digital editing at MIT in 2021 and 2022.
